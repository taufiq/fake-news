"0","A small meteorite crashed into a wooded area in Nicaragua's capital of Managua overnight, the government said Sunday. Residents reported hearing a mysterious boom that left a 16-foot deep crater near the city's airport, the Associated Press reports. 

Government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo said a committee formed by the government to study the event determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth."" House-sized asteroid 2014 RC, which measured 60 feet in diameter, skimmed the Earth this weekend, ABC News reports. 
Murillo said Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened.

The crater left by the meteorite had a radius of 39 feet and a depth of 16 feet,  said Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies who was on the committee. He said it is still not clear if the meteorite disintegrated or was buried.

Humberto Garcia, of the Astronomy Center at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua, said the meteorite could be related to an asteroid that was forecast to pass by the planet Saturday night.

""We have to study it more because it could be ice or rock,"" he said.

Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was ""very strange that no one reported a streak of light. We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

Local residents reported hearing a loud boom Saturday night, but said they didn't see anything strange in the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast. We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria told The Associated Press.

The site of the crater is near Managua's international airport and an air force base. Only journalists from state media were allowed to visit it."

"5","(NEWSER) – Wonder how long a Quarter Pounder with cheese can last? Two Australians say they bought a few McDonald's burgers for friends back in 1995, when they were teens, and one of the friends never showed up. So the kid's burger went uneaten—and stayed that way, Australia's News Network reports. ""We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,"" says one of the men, Casey Dean. Holding onto the burger for their friend ""started off as a joke,"" he adds, but ""the months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""

Dean and his burger-buying mate, Eduard Nitz, even took the burger on Australian TV show The Project last night and ""showed off the mold-free specimen,"" News 9 reports. The pair offered to take a bite of it for charity but were dissuaded by the show's hosts. They've also started a Facebook page for the burger called ""Can This 20 Year Old Burger Get More Likes Than Kanye West?"" that has more than 4,044 likes as of this writing. And they're selling an iTunes song, ""Free the Burger,"" for $1.69, and giving proceeds to the charity Beyond Blue, which helps Australians battle anxiety and depression. (A few years ago, a man sold a 20-year-old bottle of McDonald's McJordan sauce for $10,000. Here's why Mickey D's food seemingly never decays.)"
"6","Posting photos of a gun-toting child online, ISIS supporters announced that the group’s youngest soldier has died in combat.

Twitter accounts linked to the Islamic State of Iraq and Al-Sham claimed that the child soldier “got martyred” with his father while fighting for the terrorist group in Syria.

Photos posted on Twitter showed the smiling boy in military fatigues holding weapons that, at times, are almost as large as his body. British media reported that the child was roughly 10 years old.

The photos of the boy first emerged in June, said Charlie Cooper, a researcher who monitors ISIS social media for the London-based Quilliam counter-extremism think tank.
In the past week, Mr. Cooper has noticed the hashtag “shibal_alBaghdadi” — which translates as “the cub of Baghdadi” — on Twitter accounts linked to ISIS.

While ISIS fighters commonly refer to themselves as lions of the Islamic State, Mr. Cooper said, they refer to child soldiers as cubs of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, ISIS’s self-proclaimed caliph.

Mr. Cooper first saw ISIS supporters tweeting that the young boy was dead on Sept. 26. And while he says social media often produces fabricated reports to make ISIS seem “more brutal than it is,” the reports of the dead child appear to be coming directly from ISIS. One Twitter account said the boy was killed in a U.S. air strike, though that has not been confirmed.

ISIS supporters identified the boy as Abu Ubaidah.

“It seems like a very legitimate thing,” Mr. Cooper said in a telephone interview Thursday, adding that ISIS is known to use child soldiers. “I would vouch for it.”

A United Nations report on Iraq this month said children conduct patrols for ISIS, arrest and guard prisoners, carry weapons and are forced to give blood to help injured fighters. While the boy allegedly killed last month was listed as 10, the UN said child soldiers with ISIS are as young 12 and 13 years old.
Children are also frequently used in ISIS propaganda, with photos showing children in “uniform and parading alongside adults being frequently posted on social media,” the UN reported.

“Everyone at NATO headquarters is worried about the use of children by ISIS,” said Shelly Whitman, executive director of the Halifax-based Romeo Dallaire Child Soldiers Initiative.

“If we [Canada] send boots on the ground, we’re going to see this face to face,” she said.

Currently, the six-month Canadian mission in Iraq will be limited to air strikes, with a ban on deploying any combat troops on the ground."
"7","At least 25 suspected Boko Haram insurgents were killed in clashes between soldiers and the Islamist militants in northeast Nigeria and five civilians were killed in fighting elsewhere in the region, a military source and residents said on Monday.

A ceasefire agreement between Boko Haram and the Nigerian government was expected to lead to the liberation of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the militants six months ago, and talks were due to continue in neighbouring Chad on Monday.

Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least six attacks over the weekend – blamed by security sources on the insurgents – that have killed several dozen people since the announcement of the ceasefire.

A government spokesman has said that the fighting on Sunday may be the work of criminal gangs in the lawless region.

An army officer, who requested anonymity, said the militants tried to enter the town of Damboa late on Sunday through Alagarno, a Boko Haram hideout, but soldiers fought them off. “Our men gunned down 25 of the insurgents because they would have entered Damboa and unleashed more terror on the town that is just picking up from its ruins,” the officer said.

He said an armoured vehicle and some arms were recovered from the insurgents.

Damboa, a garrison town near the border with Cameroon, has been the site of fierce fighting between the militants and Nigerian forces for months. The insurgents sacked the town in July but were driven out by an army counter-offensive.

A member of pro-government Civilian Joint Task Force vigilantes, Mohammed Haruna, said of clashes on Sunday, “Two of our members came to [the town of] Biu this morning from Damboa and said the soldiers engaged Boko Haram yesterday and the battle lasted till about midnight.”

Separately, Maiduguri resident Andrew Tada, said the insurgents killed five people in Gava, a hilly town in Gwoza Local Government Area not far from Damboa.

Tada said his brother in Gava was lucky to have escaped to the top of a mountain.

“My brother is still there now with other relatives, women and children,” he told Reuters after speaking with his brother on the phone.

“They [the militants] came yesterday [Sunday] while people were scouting for food at the foot of the mountain. When the insurgents sighted our people, they pursued them and slaughtered five,” Tada said."
"8","There is so much fake stuff on the Internet in any given week that we’ve grown tired of debunking it all. Fake Twitter fights. Fake DHL ads. Amazing viral video? Nope — a Jimmy Kimmel stunt!

So, rather than take down each and every undeservedly viral story that crosses our monitors each week, we’re rounding them all up in a quick, once-a-week Friday debunk of fake photos, misleading headlines and bad studies that you probably shouldn’t share over the weekend.

Ready? Here’s what was fake on the Internet this week:

1. The Nobel Committee doesn’t “regret” giving President Obama the Peace Prize. According to an invented “news release” uploaded to Scribd by the prominent blogger and anti-war activist David Swanson, the Nobel Institute can’t retract Obama’s 2009 Peace Prize — but wishes it could. “It remains the obligation of the Committee to disassociate itself from actions taken by laureates that frustrate rather than advancing [sic] the fraternity between nations,” the statement reads. (Pro-tip: International organizations rarely make glaring grammatical errors in major statements.) “The Committee therefore joins with the public statements of several Nobel Peace Laureates in expressing its regrets over the conduct of the 2009 prize recipient.” The announcement has since been picked up by a number of right-wing outlets, including Before It’s News. The only problem, of course: It isn’t true.

Dear Internet: The Nobel committee ″regrets” giving Obama the 2009 peace prize story is bogus. I just spoke with the head of the institute

2. There is no-such thing as a “pumpkin-spice-flavored condom.” Though considering the social media response to the idea, some enterprising company may want to give it a try. A Photoshopped image of the “limited edition” Durex condom circulated widely on Twitter and Facebook last week before a punny statement from Durex punctured the hoax: “We can’t claim this one,” the company said, “but we do love it when people spice it up in the bedroom.” Har har. In unrelated pumpkin-spice news, the limited-edition Oreos of the flavor are apparently quite real.

We’ve officially reached Pumpkin Spice saturation point. pic.twitter.com/Tve77ov5JZ

3. No one expects “record-shattering snowfall” this year. That claim — like so many others! — comes from the unfunny “satirists” at EmpireNews.net, increasingly our least favorite fake-news site in a generally unfavorable field. According to the story and its accompanying map, meteorologists have expected “above normal snowfall” in huge swaths of the United States, including the entire mid-Atlantic coast. Like everything else on Empire News, of course, the map is fake. Moreover, it’s so difficult to predict seasonal weather patterns that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration doesn’t bust theirs out until November, and the Climate Prediction Center in College Park, Md., told the Baltimore Sun they have virtually no idea what the snow will look like three long months from now.

#InOtherNews I just read a report that a meteorologist said we will be having ″record shattering snowfall” this winter. Lord Jesus.

4. “Male birth control” will probably not be here by 2017. A number of outlets gleefully proclaimed the news that a “male birth control” injection, called Vasalgel, would be hitting the world’s bedrooms within three years. Alas, that would seem to suggest that Vasalgel has been proven to work in humans, or that it’s already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration — and neither of those things are true. “The news came from a press release — and call for donations! — by the foundation behind Vasalgel,” Julia Belluz explained at Vox, “highlighting some promising (though again, unpublished, anecdotal findings) from testing on baboons.” Bottom line: It’s great that someone’s working on male birth control, but it’s highly unlikely this particular product will reach the U.S. market by 2017.

5. There was not a shooting at a California Marine Corps base. An anonymous Facebook page sparked all-out panic at a base north of San Diego on Thursday night when it posted that a shooter was active at the military installation and that “ALL MARINES HAVE BEEN INSTRUCTED TO LOCK THEMSELVES INSIDE OF THEIR ROOMS.” The page then stupidly followed that prank post up with a number of “updates” on the situation, which were liked and shared hundreds of times. Base police told Business Insider there was no evidence at all of a shooting: People “saw if on social media networks and then they started telling their friends,” one dispatcher said. “It’s all rumor, it’s all hearsay.”

Possible shooter in Camp Pendleton!? Anybody hear anything??

6. Shakira is not dead. The singer’s hips don’t lie, but the Internet does. Constantly. A hoax e-mail bearing the logo of Mexican newspaper El Universal claimed that Shakira died in a car accident in Colombia last week, and that an attached Word document contained “exclusive images and details” from the scene. Colombia’s Informador reports that the e-mail may actually have contained a virus or phishing scam. As for Shakira, she’s alive and well and expecting her second child with boyfriend Gerard Pique.

7. British Muslims are not trying to outlaw a beloved children’s TV show. A comedian going by the name Zayn Sheikh outraged many Brits (and fooled a number of news outlets, British and otherwise) with a YouTube video that demanded the TV show “Peppa Pig” go off air and suggested a national campaign would soon organize for that purpose. Peppa Pig is a beloved, alliterative British cartoon character — and also “haram,” or forbidden to Muslims, Sheikh claimed. Over the weekend, Sheikh posted a second video admitting the whole thing was a hoax — but a hoax for a cause. “This video served to show how much Islamophobia is around, for those who deny its existence,” he wrote. “It is sad to live in a society where some feel that Muslims have no rights to talk at all.”

8. Obama will not “resign amid new Benghazi revelations.” Every word of this headline is a dream come true to some of the president’s more conspiracy-minded opponents, which perhaps explains why the fake article, from fake-article-generator National Report, went viral in those circles. As of this writing, it’s been shared more than 60,000 times on Facebook. Even Donald Trump seems to have fallen for the “joke”!

If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country—I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!

(Just kidding, that tweet is related to another matter entirely.)

9. Cocaine has not been found in Coors Light beer. Since this is the second widespread cocaine-in-a-beverage hoax in as many weeks, let’s get a few things straight about the alleged phenomenon. First up: This hoax seems to do well because it has some remote, and long ago, bases in fact. (Cocaine-laced sodas and beverages were very popular in ye olden days, around the time of the Civil War.) It also helps that remote traces of coca have been found, at some point in time, in various popular beverages, including Red Bull. That said, no cocaine expose published on a site called Huzlers.com is ever going to be real. Ever. How have 286,000 people shared this stupid thing?

10. The ruins of an ancient city were not discovered in the Australian desert. Perhaps the most incredible thing about this faux-story from World News Daily Report — besides the number of times people have reposted it to Facebook — is the amazingly credulous conversation readers are having in the comments section below it. “I thought the climate in central Australia had been arid for over 30,000 years,” one commenter wrote. “30,000 people living in the desert? That would require agriculture and irrigation … That’s just incredible!” Indeed.

Did we miss any other notable fake stuff this week? E-mail caitlin.dewey@washpost.com — or stay tuned until next week, because surely some more shenanigans will go down in the meantime."
"9","(CNN) -- A meteorite crashed down in Managua, Nicaragua, late Saturday night, causing a loud explosion and leaving a crater 39 feet (12 meters) across, government officials said, according to The Associated Press. No damage or injuries were reported.

AP quoted government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying they've determined it was a ""relatively small"" meteorite that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

NASA hasn't confirmed a link between the meteorite and the asteroid. The newly discovered asteroid, called 2014 RC, was expected to pass safely above the Earth on Sunday, NASA said, at a distance of about 25,000 miles (40,000 kilometers) -- just one-tenth the distance from the center of Earth to the moon. It was estimated to be 60 feet (18 meters) long.

Local media reported that scientists are trying to find remains of the meteorite, and Nicaragua is asking the United States to help investigate the event.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed on-site corresponds exactly with a meteorite,"" Jose Millan with the Nicaraguan Institute of Earth Studies was quoted as saying on the Today Nicaragua website.

But NASA's Bill Cooke is skeptical.

""It has been suggested that a meteorite may have caused this crater; however, the lack of fireball reports from the surrounding populated area seems to suggest some other cause,"" Cooke wrote in a NASA blog post.

""The skies were partially clear, and an object capable of producing a crater this large would have also generated a very bright fireball (brighter than the Full Moon) that should have been seen over a wide area.""

The Today Nicaragua site reported the crater was found after a loud blast about 11:05 p.m. on Saturday. The Nicaragua Dispatch said the hole is in the woods near Managua's Sandino International Airport and about 1,000 feet (300 meters) from the Camino Real Hotel.

NASA's Near Earth Object Program estimates there are thousands of asteroids that could threaten Earth, but experts say none of the ones being tracked is expected to hit the planet anytime soon.

Sometimes, though, space rocks sneak by the scientists and amateur astronomers who track them. On February 15, 2013, a nearly 60-foot-wide meteor plunged into Earth's atmosphere and exploded over the Russian city of Chelyabinsk with the force of about 30 nuclear bombs. The blast injured about 1,500 people.

The Chelyabinsk meteor was undetected before it was spotted by local residents as it streaked across the sky. It exploded on the same day that Asteroid 2012 DA14, one that was being carefully tracked by NASA, safely passed by Earth.

NASA is trying to speed up the way it tracks potentially hazardous asteroids and to learn how to deflect rocks that threaten Earth. Its Asteroid Initiative includes a plan to capture an asteroid and tug it into orbit around the moon in the 2020s. If it works, astronauts will land on the asteroid, take samples and bring them back to Earth.

Word has it that Amazon is looking to launch an ad-supported streaming video service, which could give rivals a run for their money. The online retail giant is planning to roll out the new service early next year, the New York Post reported on Friday. It would be separate from Amazon's $99 yearly Prime membership, which offers unlimited movie streaming from the Instant Video library.
In a statement, an Amazon spokeswoman neither confirmed nor denied the rumor.
""We currently offer the first episode of some television shows free with ads through our First Episode Free feature on Amazon Instant Video, and there are display ads on some short videos such as movie and game trailers,"" the spokeswoman said. ""We're often experimenting with new offers and experiences for customers, but we have not announced any plans to offer an ad-supported video streaming service.""
This isn't the first time we've heard this rumor. The Wall Street Journal in March reported that Amazon was planning to launch its own advertising-filled TV streaming service — free to users, of course. Amazon, however, quickly shot down that rumor.
""We're often experimenting with new things, but we have no plans to offer a free streaming-media service,"" an Amazon spokesperson said at the time.

But the Post's sources now say an ad-supported version is definitely happening. But oddly, the report suggests that it might not be free. One source speculated that Amazon may undercut Netflix's current monthly price of $7.99, though.
""The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn't want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,"" a source told the news outlet.
Meanwhile, Amazon is already gaining ground on streaming rivals. A recent Sandvine study found that Amazon Instant Video has established itself as the second largest paid streaming video service in North America, though Netflix still dominates.
Netflix accounted for 34.9 percent of downstream North American traffic in the peak evening hours this year. Amazon had only 2.6 percent of downstream traffic, but its share has more than doubled in the past 18 months, Sandvine said.
On other news, Amazon is also mulling its own travel service, which would let you book stays at independent hotels and resorts, according to a report from travel news site Skift. The so-called Amazon Travel site, set to launch around Jan. 1, would reportedly ""feature a curated selection of hotels within a few hours' drive from New York, Los Angeles, and Seattle.""
Amazon declined to comment about the travel site rumor.

"11","We’ve all seen the traditional depictions of God as a cloud-dwelling figure with a flowing mane and a white beard.

But now, a Catholic priest in America has apparently claimed that God is female, after he officially died for 48 minutes following a massive heart attack.

According to an unverified report, Father John Micheal O’Neal, 71, briefly went to heaven and met a ‘warm and comforting’ motherly figure as doctors battled to save his life at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Although doctors feared that the religious cleric would have suffered brain damage, he woke up only 48 hours later and has recovered from the heart attack.

Recalling his experience, the priest apparently said that he was engulfed by a feeling of unconditional love as he met God, who he described as a mother-like ‘being of light’.

He said: ‘Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting.

‘She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace.

‘The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more.’

O’Neal has reportedly said that he will continue to spread the word of God, despite the Archbishop of Boston moving to rubbish the claims of a ‘Holy Mother’.

He added: ‘I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman.’"

U.S. military officials say they are investigating claims that Islamic State fighters seized a cache of weapons that were airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces and meant for Kurdish militiamen.

A video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State showed a cache of weapons including hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers. Their claims would appear to correspond with those of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which said the militants had seized at least one cache.

U.S. officials said Tuesday they could not confirm the video's authenticity but are looking into the claims.

""We just don't know. We're still looking at it,"" Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said when asked about the video, while stressing that the ""vast majority"" of supplies ended up in the right hands.

The supplies were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobani that lies near the Turkish border. The militant Islamic State has been trying to seize the town for over a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

In all, 28 bundles of equipment -- including medical supplies, weapons and ammunition -- were dropped. The Pentagon says 27 bundles were received.

According to Pentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren, ""one of those bundles drifted off course."" But he said ""we subsequently destroyed it with an airstrike.""

On Tuesday, though, Islamic State loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said ""Team USA.""

Kirby acknowledged the conflicting accounts. ""We're aware that one bundle did not make it into the right hands and you saw the CENTCOM release indicating that they destroyed it from the air,"" he said. ""All of that doesn't take away from the notion that this video is out there and that it could in fact be that bundle. We just don't know.""

The lost weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The Islamic State militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

On Tuesday, U.S. Central Command said U.S. military forces conducted four airstrikes near Kobani that destroyed Islamic State fighting positions, a building and a large Islamic State unit.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees and the Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The airstrikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamic rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S.-led coalition has been conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants elsewhere in Syria.

A dog has been found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase filled with his belongings.

The Scottish SPCA is keen to trace the owner of shar pei-crossbeed Kai, who was discovered tied to a railing outside Ayr station on Friday.

He was accompanied by a case containing items including a pillow, toy, food and bowl.

The dog was sold on the Gumtree website in 2013 and the charity is appealing for information to help trace whoever bought him.

Scottish SPCA inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.

PA   Pooch passing through: Kai was found tied to a railing at Ayr station

""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about.

""Regardless of the fact Kai was left with his belongings, this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible. If anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible.

""Kai is around two to three years old and is a lovely dog with a nice nature. We will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home.""

Station staff looked after Kai until the Scottish SPCA arrived at the scene on Friday.

He is now being cared for at the charity's centre in Glasgow.

The charity said abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life."
"17","An article saying NASA confirmed six days of “total darkness” in December is fake and it’s merely an iteration of an old Internet hoax.

Essentially every year, there’s bogus rumors saying that there will be three days of darkness in December, but they’ve obviously proven not to be true.

They seem to reference the Three Days of Darkness mentioned by Catholic prophets.

However, a “satirical” and entertainment website, Huzlers.com, posted an article about six days of darkness. It uses fake quotes from a NASA official.

“WORLDWIDE – NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December. The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight,” it reads in part.

But Huzlers has a disclaimer that says it’s not real and shouldn’t ever be taken seriously.

“Huzlers.com is a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelier,” the About Us section reads on the bottom of each web page.

The bogus NASA article had tens of thousands of shares and “likes” on Saturday.

According to Snopes.com, similar rumors have been going on for a while and have taken on different forms.

“No, the universe is not about to realign in December 2014, nor will there be a three-day blackout at that time during which the Earth will shift into a new dimension. Neither NASA nor any other credible scientific entity has made such a pronouncement. Ever,” the site says. “This item originated back in 2012, when interest in the belief that the Mayan calendar would end on 21 December 2012 (thus foretelling the end of the world as we know it) was running high, and it has simply been updated and recirculated with the year 2014 replacing the original references to 2012.”"

The report says that HBO is targeting a launch for Now in early April, ahead of the start date for Game of Thrones. While Game of Thrones would be a great way for HBO to drive subscriptions to the new service, it'll have to be careful if it plans to do that: last year, HBO's online streaming option for cable subscribers, HBO Go, wouldn't work for many who were trying to watch during the premiere. That would be a very bad look for a new service, and the Times says that HBO doesn't plan on launching until it's satisfied that it can do so without issue.

Apple is reportedly one of the partners that HBO could launch its new service with. According to the Times, Apple has been aggressive in its attempts to secure a place as one of HBO's launch partners. If a deal is made, Apple TV users would be able to access and stream HBO Now, potentially through a standalone app. Apple has been adding more and more channels to the Apple TV over the last couple years, and the addition of HBO's subscription streaming service would make its device all the more appealing. The Times notes that HBO's parent company wants to see this service be accessible on platforms like the Roku, Xbox, and PlayStation as well, but it's not clear if discussions are ongoing. Nonetheless, it seems likely that HBO would want to work with multiple major partners to get this service out there.

It's still not known what HBO's subscription streaming service will actually offer. Though many will hope for the same access that HBO Go receives — that is, all of HBO's original content and the movies it's currently playing — it's possible that won't be the case. HBO may want to position this service as something distinctly different from its cable service as a way to prevent subscribers from moving online. On the other hand, the $15 per month fee may mean that HBO is earning about as much regardless of how you subscribe. That price would make it tougher to compete with Netflix, but HBO hasn't exactly had trouble finding people willing to pay subscription fees that high in the past. With the even wider audience that this service will open it up to, HBO may not be that worried."
"23","In a sprawling Facebook post and subsequent interview with Radar Online, a woman named Taylor Lianne Chandler has made a number of fascinating claims about herself and her alleged relationship with Michael Phelps. Among them: she was born intersex with ambiguous genitalia, met the Olympic swimmer on Tinder, and fucked said Olympic swimmer on their first date watching football on TV.

""Many of you have wondered why I was so freaked out about my relationship with Michael Phelps being exposed,"" the 41-year-old D.C.-area woman begins her post. ""Here is the truth.""

I was born intersex and named David Roy Fitch at birth. By the time I could walk and talk I made it clear I was a girl and dressed as one. In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery.
Citing an anonymous tipster (that could very well have been Chandler herself), The Hollywood Gossip previously named Chandler as Michael Phelps' companion the night of his latest DUI, a claim repeated in her recent Facebook post.

Yes, I was with Michael the night of the DUI, the story of the Uber and crying and me wanting to stay with him that night are true. A lot of the other things printed are lies. I am probably going to lose him because he is a brand that his team wants to protect and things since he went to rehab came to my attention that didn't put him or our relationship in the best light. He is the first man I ever had intimacy with and felt comfortable and all woman.
Today, Chandler followed up her announcement by giving Radar Online additional details of her supposed first date with Phelps after meeting him on Tinder, which involved watching a Baltimore Ravens game at the athlete's home. ""One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,"" Chandler told the site. ""Later, we had sex again.""

Chandler says she only told Phelps about her past once the ""threat of the media exposing me forced me too.""

I am telling my story to take the power away from the media and tabloids that want to hurt Michael and I. I will probably lose him, which hurts like hell.

A fake news report also claimed that the ""Home Alone"" star was found dead in his Manhattan apartment. Fortunately, none of this is true. 

The actor's representatives issued a statement about the hoax.

""He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and, well, stop believing what you see on the Internet.""

"25","DUBAI - A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, describing them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: ""It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.""

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

""God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,"" he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

""They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,"" one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a ""snow bride"" wearing a bra and lipstick. ""The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,"" he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people:

""A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,"" the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. ""It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,"" one wrote.

""May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.""

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East."
"26","Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured. Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page. The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible. Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting. Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north. Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet.

"27","Phoenix, AZ — A Phoenix boy is behind bars tonight after his mother called 9-1-1 when she found her son in his room, watching pornography and masturbating. Phoenix Police were quick to respond, arresting 15-year-old Paul Horner, who attends North Valley High School in Phoenix, Arizona. Now the teenager is being held without bail and charged by prosecutors under a new controversial Arizona state law called ‘Self-Rape’, which carries a minimum of 3 years in prison with a maximum of 15 years behind bars depending on that individuals past criminal history.

This is the first time this new state law has been used since it was put into action last month by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer. Brewer spoke with local news station ABC 15 about the charges against the boy.

“I applaud the Arizona District court systems here in Phoenix,” Brewer said. “This is exactly why I implemented the state law of ‘Self-Rape’ last month and this is exactly what it is meant to be used for. Before my time as governor is up early next year, I’ll do whatever I can to ensure that tragedies like this don’t happen again. We need to educate our children about the dangers and consequences of masturbation before it’s too late.”

Horner, after hearing his charges by the Honorable Judge Stevens of the United States District Court in Phoenix, which included the brand new ‘Self-Rape’ state law, Horner immediately broke down into tears and had to be restrained by bailiffs.

Transcripts of the 9-1-1 call were released to the public:

“911, what’s your emergency?”

“Help! My son is watching porn and masturbating! That is not allowed in his house and I don’t know what kind of demons possessed him to degrade his body in such a matter. I’m so shakin’ up! Please send help immediately!”

32-year-old Adeline Horner, Horner’s mother, who is a self-proclaimed fanatical Baptist follower, told CNN she is still in shock.

“Up until now, my young, precious boy had no run-ins with the law, no drugs or alcohol, was a straight-A student, was in numerous extra curricular activities and played starting center on the boys Varsity basketball team,” Horner’s mother said. “But somewhere along the way he started playing on the Devil’s playground. Hopefully because of my quick thinking and actions my son will soon be able to get the help he so badly needs. I pray for it; please Jesus, save our family!”

Winters controversial actions have been applauded by some, for example, Lonnie Childs, president and founder of the federally funded Christian anti-masturbation organization STOP Masturbation NOW.

“STOP Masturbation NOW ministries have nominated Adeline Horner for our coveted Mother of the Year award,” Childs told reporters. “She really stepped up, provided moral discipline and leadership under such difficult conditions. My prayer app has been activated and I send this brave, courageous woman nothing but the best during these difficult times. I encourage you all all to do the same.”

A mascot for the Christian organization, Fappy The Ant-Masturbation Dolphin, whose real name is 36-year-old Paul Horner from Phoenix, Arizona, told reporters he is pleased with the justice served today and is confident this will set a precedent for all the would be masturbators out there.

“Fappy® has helped tens of thousands of adults and children around the world learn to live a masturbation-free lifestyle. During our visits to schools around the world, our organization has collected thousands of signatures from children promising to never masturbate; we have done great things. Our organization is passionate about the great work that we do. The children even have a nickname for Fappy®, they call him the tickle monster. Working side by side with such great women as Jan Brewer, we’re ridding the demons from these heathens pants, one pair of pants at a time. Fappy® vows to stay on this case until justice is served!”

Tom Downey with the Phoenix Police Department, who took the child into custody, spoke with Arizona news station Fox 10 News about the arrest.

“We thought at first he was possibly intoxicated or mentally unstable, ya know, talking about how we should leave him alone and just let him watch his filth, makes me sick! It’s a slippery slope my friend, one day it’s masturbating to porn, the next day it’s raping some innocent school girl. Thank God we got this heathen off the streets before another tragedy could have occurred.” Downey continued, “There’s no better feeling than putting the real bad guys behind bars. Nothing better than that. I know I can sleep better at night just knowing another criminal is off the streets.”

Officers confiscated the pornography and lube found in the teenagers room as evidence.

Prosecutors told local reporters that based on the severity of the crime, the new Arizona state law of Self-Rape [A.R.S. §§ 29-169 & 48-69] would carry a minimum of 3 years with a maximum of 15 years depending on that criminals past history.

Horner is currently being held at the Maricopa County Jail in Phoenix, Arizona. He presently has no bond set and the judge has restricted him from seeing visitors. Horner’s next scheduled court appearance is December 2nd.

Fappy The Anti-Masturbation Dolphin and Stop Masturbation Now are federally funded programs designed to teach both children and adults about the dangers and consequences of masturbation. For more information or if you would like the group to visit your child’s school call (785) 273-0325. To contact Arizona Governor Jan Brewer, call (602) 542-4331.

"29","Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is a former West London rapper who performed under the name L Jinny.

A British rapper now fighting with the Islamic State (aka ISIS) is reportedly a suspect in the beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to several unconfirmed published reports, including the Independent.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, a former West London rapper who performed under the name L Jinny, is allegedly one of three British jihadists identified as possibly being the masked murderer known as “John the Beatle,” according to the Daily Mail.

A former hostage held by ISIS said Bary is one of several jihadists nicknamed “The Beatles” because of their British accents. He has a similar accent, build and skin tone to “John,” the man who killed Foley, according to a report published in the Telegraph. 

""We have not identified who the man in the video is at this time,"" a representative from Scotland Yard told Billboard.

Bary was an aspiring rapper whose music was played on BBC Radio in 2012, according to the Independent. He left his home in Maida Vale, West London, to fight in Syria’s civil war, saying he was “leaving everything for the sake of Allah,” the Daily Mail reports.

Bary’s songs have been posted online, with titles like “Overdose,” “Flying High,” “Dreamer” and “The Beginning.” His music makes reference to violence, drug use and threats of his family being deported to Egypt. “I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings,” he reportedly raps in one song.

Bary, one of six children, is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on charges tied to the deadly bombings of embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, according to the New York Post. Earlier this year, Bary reportedly tweeted a gruesome photo of himself holding a severed head under the name “Terrorist” (@ItsLJinny). The account has since been deactivated.

"30","DNA tests confirm Lebanon is holding the young daughter of Islamic State (IS) leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the country's interior minister says.

Nohad Machnouk told Lebanon's MTV television that the child's mother, who is also in custody, was now believed to be one of Baghdadi's ex-wives.

On Tuesday, Lebanese security officials said they had detained his wife and son at a border crossing with Syria.

But Iraq's government later insisted the woman was not married to Baghdadi.

It said the woman - identified as Saja al-Dulaimi - was the daughter of an active member of al-Qaeda's affiliate in Syria, al-Nusra Front.

She is also thought to have been detained by the Syrian authorities before being freed in March as part of a prisoner exchange with al-Nusra.

Pregnant

Late on Wednesday, Mr Machnouk told MTV that Ms Dulaimi had been travelling with two sons and a daughter when they were detained by the army two weeks ago.

""Dulaimi is not Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's wife currently. She has been married three times: first to a man from the former Iraqi regime, with whom she had two sons,"" he said.

""Six years ago she married Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi for three months, and she had a daughter with him. Now, she is married to a Palestinian and she is pregnant with his child.""

The minister added: ""We conducted DNA tests on her and the daughter, which showed she was the mother of the girl, and that the girl is [Baghdadi's] daughter, based on DNA from Baghdadi from Iraq.""

It is not clear how the Iraqi authorities have the IS leader's DNA. However, in 2005 he was arrested by US forces in Iraq and spent the next four years a prisoner at Camp Bucca, near the southern town of Um Qasr, before being handed over to the Iraqi authorities and then released.

Mr Machnouk said Ms Dulaimi's children were staying at a care centre while she was being interrogated at the defence ministry's headquarters.

IS has not commented on their detention, but al-Nusra has condemned it.

One Lebanese official has said it is a ""powerful card to apply pressure"" in negotiations with IS and al-Nusra, who are holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and police hostage. They are threatening to kill them unless militants are freed from Lebanese jails."
"32","FERGUSON, St. Louis (CNN) — Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown’s shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson police on August 9, the man’s attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots — a cluster of six, followed by four.

“I was very concerned about that pause … because it’s not just the number of gunshots, it’s how they’re fired,” the man’s attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN’s Don Lemon. “And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.”

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man’s recording late last week from a mutual friend.

“I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,” Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It’s difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

“It’s the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless — he has no weapon,” said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn’t automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

“To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,” said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN’s Crossfire. “Maybe the officer will say, ‘Well I fired, and he kept advancing, so I fired again.'”

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown’s death.

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown’s body.

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience storeshortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that including lying to police has put Johnson’s credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn’t understand why some are questioning his credibility.

“I see they bring up my past, my history, but it’s not like it’s a long rap sheet,” Johnson told Lemon. “This one incident shouldn’t make me a bad person.”"
"34","Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, who went by the rap name L. Jinny or Lyricist Jinn, is a suspect in the beheading of journalist James Foley this week.

Bary, 24, is said to have left home last year to join rebels in Syria. According to TMZ, he had music played on the BBC.

The Independent newspaper reported that he tweeted a photo of himself holding up a severed head earlier in August. ”Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him,” he tweeted.

Ex-ISIS hostages have said that he has the nickname “John the Beatle” because of his British accent. Some analysts have said that the killer in the Foley video had a British accent.

Bary had lived in Maida Vale, located in west London, reported the Independent.

His father was Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee who is said to have been an aide to Osama bin Laden.

In tracks he uploaded to YouTube in 2012, Bary talks about violence and drug use. ”It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he said in one of his tracks. ”I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there’s funds in the bank.

He added: “I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain’t got normal feelings.”

The Associated Press update: Obama again faces tug of military action in Syria WASHINGTON (AP) — For three years, President Barack Obama has resisted the pull of potential U.S. military action in Syria.

He has held firm even as the civil war’s death toll climbed toward 200,000, the Syrian government used chemical weapons against civilians and Islamic State militants strengthened amid the chaos.

Now Obama must decide whether the extremist group’s murder of American journalist James Foley, as well as the broader threat the group could pose to U.S. interests, should change his cautious calculus.

Pressure is coming from his own military leaders to go after the Islamic State inside Syria. But he must weigh that against his aversion to the risks that could come with plunging the United States into a country torn apart by an intractable internal conflict.

White House officials have suggested that airstrikes in Syria are an option, though the officials say specific military proposals has not yet been presented to the president.

“We’re actively considering what’s going to be necessary to deal with that threat, and we’re not going to be restricted by borders,” said Ben Rhodes, Obama’s deputy national security adviser. “We’ve shown time and again that if there’s a counterterrorism threat, we’ll take direct action against that threat, if necessary.”

Even before Foley’s murder, Obama found himself on far different footing in the Middle East than he probably expected in the sixth year of his presidency.

After running for the White House on a pledge to end the Iraq war and then making good on that promise in late 2011, Obama thrust the U.S. military back into Iraq this month with a limited airstrike campaign against Islamic State targets.

Obama has said he will not send U.S. combat troops to another ground war in the Mideast. But expanding the airstrikes in Iraq and broadening them to include Syria could mean a lengthy American military commitment in the region that could consume much of Obama’s remaining time in office.

“What we should have learned over the past dozen years in that part of the world is that the use of military power is very unpredictable,” said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government.

That may be particularly true in Syria, where President Bashar Assad’s government is warring with opposition forces. Unlike in Iraq, the battle lines are more clearly drawn. Syria has a host of military players in close proximity to each other, including the Islamic State, the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front, mainstream Western-backed rebels and pro-government forces.

The Islamic State is among the groups fighting Assad, meaning a U.S. campaign to weaken the extremists could actually strengthen a leader the White House has sought to push from office.

Obama could try to counteract that uncomfortable dynamic by also taking strikes against Assad, though that could put the U.S. on the hook for the kind of long-term commitment to rebuilding Syria that he has tried to avoid.

The risks are no less troubling if Obama allows the Islamic State to continue having unfettered access to a safe haven in Syria. Politically, it could bolster the argument from his critics that he is overseeing an American retreat on the world stage. It also could give the militants space to strengthen and become a threat not just to U.S. interests in the region, but also to the U.S. at home.

Obama’s own military leadership made clear in recent days that the threat from the Islamic State cannot be fully eliminated without going after the group in Syria, as well as Iraq.

“This is an organization that has an apocalyptic, end-of-days strategic vision and which will eventually have to be defeated,” said Army Gen. Martin Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. “Can they be defeated without addressing that part of their organization which resides in Syria? The answer is no. That will have to be addressed on both sides of what is essentially at this point a nonexistent border.”

To White House critics, the unappetizing options are the result of Obama’s own foreign policy missteps. They argue that he gave extremists an opening in Iraq by not doing more to reach an agreement with the Iraqi government to leave U.S. forces in the country after 2011. They say his decision to not provide heavy weaponry to more moderate rebel groups in Syria also helped facilitate the Islamic State’s rise.

Without a course correction, Obama’s critics argue, the U.S. will be at greater risk.

“If we do not do more to assist our Iraqi partners and those moderate Syrians who are fighting ISIL and directly target ISIL’s leadership and networks in Iraq and Syria, I fear that James Foley will not be the only American to die at their hands,” said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., using one of the acronyms for the Islamic State.

Obama’s advisers say the responsibility for stemming the rise of the Islamic State does not rest solely with the United States. The White House has been imploring Sunni states in the region — Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates in particular — to wield their influence with tribal leaders in Iraq and get them to push the Islamic State out of areas they have occupied.

The U.S. also has been discussing ways that allies such as Britain, France, Australia and Canada can become involved through intelligence sharing, military assistance for Kurdish forces in Iraq and moderate opposition forces in Syria, and if necessary, joining the U.S. in military action."

It was said Kim Yo Jong had taken over while her brother underwent medical treatment, but So Se Pyong, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, told Reuters Kim was not in bad health.

The ambassador sat down for an interview where he discussed a variety of matters, including North Korea's nuclear program, possibly negotiations to free three detained Americans and, of course, Kim’s health.

It has been rumored Kim, 31, might have had ankle surgery, but So said that is incorrect. The story emerged after Kim did not appear at the Supreme People's Assembly last month and reports said he suffered from ""discomfort.” He was also seen walking with a limp in July. ""That is rumors, fabricated rumors,"" So said about Kim's alleged ailment.

Questions about Kim’s health rose after an article from the Diplomat, a magazine based in Tokyo, claimed his sister was making important government decisions while Kim was being treated at Bonghwa Clinic in North Korea's capital Pyongyang.

""Some say Hwang Byong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, may have assumed new No. 2 status, but given what has been confirmed this time, we can say Hwang is just a shadow, and Kim Yo Jong is the second-in-command of North Korea,"" Kim Heung Gwang, the head of North Korea Intellectuals Solidarity, reportedly said.

Even if So denies any health problems, Kim has not been seen by his people since Sept. 3. The leader also gained a significant amount of weight, which could contribute to ailments like gout, diabetes or high blood pressure, sources told the Associated Press. If he were suffering from gout, his cheese eating and smoking would worsen the condition.

A new report, however, provides some possible answers to these questions. According to a French website, the Apple Watch will start at around $500 for the steel model. And gold? Gold will be even more expensive.

According to iGen.fr, the stainless steel Apple Watch in polished steel or black will cost $500 when it debuts close to Valentine’s Day of 2015. This would be a $150 premium over the anodized aluminum Sports Model, which Apple said last month would start at a price of $349.

For the gold model, expect to spend 10 times as much. According to iGen.fr’s sources, the gold Apple Watch in yellow or pink gold would cost between $4,000 and $5,000 when it goes on sale in January.

iGen.fr also suggests that the Apple Watch will rank low on the iFixIt repairability scale. They claim the only thing on the Apple Watch that will be user-replaceable is the strap, so don’t expect to be able to repair an Apple Watch the way you would a normal timepiece.

Ebola is spread through contact with bodily fluids of an infected individual

Ebola has a 90% casualty rate in areas such as West Africa. In America the mortality rate is 50/50

Five people are confirmed to have the Ebola Virus in Pardon County

CDC quarantined the area, erecting road blocks and disallowing anyone in or out of the area

A staff member at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital contacted National Report with a short statement about the Ebola situation in Texas. The individual wished to remain anonymous for their own safety, and told us the following,

“As far as we know, Jack Phillis had not come in contact with neither the late Thomas Duncan or Mrs. Phan. It is perhaps possible that he was within a close proximity of the infected parties, but it is otherwise unknown as to how Phillips was infected with Ebola.

The CDC wasted no time sealing up the rest of the town’s denizens, and has stopped all traffic entering and exiting Purdon, TX. As of 10 Pm, Oct. 13th area has been surrounded with police and CDC officials. Communications with the locals seems to have been cut off, and press is currently awaiting an official statement from local authorities."
"44","This is the shocking moment a US Marine gets shot in the head by a Taliban sniper – but is saved by his helmet.

Captured on a helmet-mounted camera, the video shows three Marines during a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province, Afghanistan, in 2013.

Upon hearing gunfire, the team move out to determine where it is coming from.

They travel through a short tunnel and then into another, where they all pause just before exiting.

Without warning, a bullet, presumably from a sniper, cracks against the helmet of one of the soldiers.

“We got a sniper,” the Marine filming exclaims, before the group rush back to protected area.

Complaining that their ears are ringing, they inspect the helmet which was hit before resolving to find out where the sniper is located.

Watch the video of the incredible incident below.

"45","Zack Snyder recently unveiled an official photo of the Batmobile from ""Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice."" But immediately after came word that one of the Batmobiles has been stolen. Nobody was surprised since production is going on in Detroit, a city with the highest crime rate.

Warner Bros never confirmed the report and its still unclear whether the vehicle was ever stolen. But Snyder just took to Twitter to make light of the situation, posting a photo of the Gotham City police recovering the Batmobile and arresting the individual responsible. ""Case closed,"" he wrote.

Meanwhile, we also have a video of the Batmobile being taken out for a spin. This is one of many videos out there. Some others show a second car with a camera on the roof recording the Batmobile in motion. Check everything out below."
"47","After campaigning on a promise to reform stop-and-frisk, Mayor Bill de Blasio is set to launch his most significant effort to address the issues raised by the policy. Law-enforcement officials tell the New York Times that soon the NYPD may issue tickets for low-level marijuana possession rather than making arrests. Under the de Blasio administration's planned changes to the city's marijuana policy, those caught with a small amount of weed would be issued a court summons, but avoid a trip to the police station. The shift could have a huge impact in black and Latino communities, as a recent study found those groups represented 86 percent of those arrested for marijuana possession in the city this year.

The de Blasio administration is still working out the details, such as how much weed one could possess without triggering an arrest, and some are already unhappy with the proposed change. Brooklyn District Attorney Kenneth Thompson, who announced this year that he would stop prosecuting small-scale marijuana possession cases, said that telling people to show up in a court room without arresting them may actually be worse for minorities.

""In order to give the public confidence in the fairness of the criminal justice system, these cases should be subject to prosecutorial review,"" Thompson explained. ""By allowing these cases to avoid early review, by issuing a summons, there is a serious concern that many summonses will be issued without the safeguards currently in place. These cases will move forward even when due process violations might have occurred.""

In other words, don't expect the debate about how NYPD officers should proceed when they catch someone with a joint to be resolved anytime soon."
"48","The interwebs was all aflutter today with news that elusive graffiti artist, political activist, film director, painter and long time fugitive that for years has gone by the pseudonymous name of Banksy, was arrested early this morning by London’s Metropolitan Police. According to reports, after hours of questioning and a raid of his London art studio, his true name and identity have finally been revealed. A video was even produced purporting to reveal Banksy’s real identity:



According to reports:

“…The City of London Police say Banksy’s real name is Paul Horner, a 35-year old male born in Liverpool, England. London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards held a press conference to answer questions about Banksy and how Horner was finally apprehended after all these years on the run. “We had a 24-hour Anti-Graffiti Task Force monitoring different groups where Banksy was known to frequent. We received word that around 2am a group of individuals left a flat speculated to be one of Banky’s art studios. This group was followed by agents and once vandalism had occurred, we then arrested the group, 5 men total. These individuals all had ID on them except for one, and that is the one we believed to be Banksy,” Edwards said.”

“We then raided the studio where this group was last seen leaving from. Inside we found thousands of dollars of counterfeit money along with future projects of vandalism. We also found a passport and ID of a Paul Horner who matched the description of the man that we are currently holding.” Edwards continued, “Horner is currently being held without bail on charges of vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting. We are also holding the other four individuals whose names we are not releasing at this time.”

(ABOVE: According to reports, this is a photo of Banksy, AKA Paul Horner, seen here being taken into police custody.)

Despite the “if it’s on the internet, it must be true” adage, we immediately smelled HOAX, so did a bit of digging (our mascot Fido is good at that).  It didn’t take long (30 seconds in fact), to rule this out as a not-very-elaborate fake.  We reached out to Banksy’s PR agent Jo Brooks, who confirmed the hoax in 3 simple words:

Banksy’s identity was long speculated to be Robin Gunningham, a man born in Bristol, England in 1973. Known for his contempt for the government in labeling graffiti as vandalism, Banksy displays his art on public walls and even goes as far as to build physical prop pieces. He does not sell his work directly; however, art auctioneers have been known to attempt to sell his street art on location and leave the problem of its removal in the hands of the winning bidder.

So we can all breath a big sigh of relief… inhale, exhale… Banksy is still a mystery. Someone. Somewhere. Phew."
"51","A Kansas City apartment building in the 3600 block of East Meyer Boulevard was sealed off because a person who lives there is sick with something that may be contagious, a source close to KCTV5 News says. (KCTV)

A Kansas City TV station, KCTV-5 reported Saturday night someone was being quarantined at Rockhill Research Hospital (Research Medical Center), according to their sister station in Wichita, KWCH.

A source in Kansas City confirmed the story to the Gateway Pundit and added some details.

A Nigerian woman was taken to the hospital with a high fever and Ebola like symptoms. Her apartment building was quarantined, though that may have been lifted later.

The source added the Nigerian woman initially tested negative for Ebola and was released (or set to be released) but was called back to the hospital. The source said parts of the hospital may be quarantined but the hospital is not confirming anything.

The CDC is reportedly on the way, according to the source."
"53","'The urge to create is equally strong in all children… boys and girls'

When it comes to promoting equality of the sexes, we tend to think that we’ve come a long way in the past 40 years.

But a letter that is believed to have been included in a 1974 Lego box set appears to show that the much-loved Danish toy company started to get there a good while before everyone else.

According to a post on the online community platform reddit.com, Lego sent a message addressed “To parents” inside the box of assorted building blocks, explaining how “the urge to create is equally strong in all children… boys and girls”.

It’s a powerful sentiment that has seen the image shared widely since user fryd_ first posted it on Saturday morning.

He said that he came across the letter while playing “with his niece and nephew at their Grandma’s house”, and that it was in a set “from 1973 with a blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house”.

Here is the letter in full:

“To Parents

“The urge to create is equally strong in all children. Boys and girls.

“It’s the imagination that counts. Not skill. You build whatever comes into your head, the way you want it. A bed or a truck. A dolls house or a spaceship.

“A lot of boys like dolls houses. They’re more human than spaceships. A lot of girls prefer spaceships. They’re more exciting than dolls houses.

“The most important thing is to put the right material in their hands and let them create whatever appeals to them.”

While the image appears to include a copyright from 1974 and the name of a printer in Hamburg used by Lego at the time, the authenticity of the letter could not be independently verified, and a spokesperson for Lego was not immediately available for comment.

User fryd_ commented that “it seems like we’ve taken a step backwards” since the letter was written. But others disagreed – with Taliesen13 responding: “That sounds like the moral of The Lego Movie.”"
"54","A nun living in an Italian convent has given birth to a surprise baby after complaining of stomach pains, according to the Italian press.

The nun, who came to Italy from South America, belonged to an order called the Missionary Sisters of the Love of Christ in Macerata, located in the Italian region of Le Marche.

She says she had no idea she was pregnant.

She was taken to hospital by her sisters, where doctors quickly told her she was pregnant, according to Italian newspaper Il Corriere Adriatico.

The baby is healthy and the nun’s convent has expressed an interest in taking care of him.

The nun arrived at the convent in June, when it is now believed she was already pregnant.

According to the Italian newspaper L’Unione Sarda, the convent said the woman ""is not a nun, is a girl that we are helping” possibly because she had not yet taken her vows.

The woman, who is reported to be from Bolivia, has now been discharged from hospital."
"55","FEARS have been raised that Islamic militants have seized a dozen commercial aircraft in an attack on a Libyan airport last week. Now, according to a report, intelligence agencies are warning the jets could be used in 9/11-style attacks.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” one official told The Washington Free Beacon this morning.

“We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The report said intelligence reports distributed within the US government over the past few weeks have detailed the types of aircraft believed seized. Several have the size and range to reach deep into Europe and Africa.

The Beacon reports the analysts as issuing a specific warning — that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack on the date marking the anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon in the United States.

It is also the second anniversary of the Libyan terrorist attack on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi.

The threat warning comes as dramatic video reveals the final moments of a Libyan combat jet.

The aircraft plunged into the ground less than a kilometre from the country’s parliament during a fly-past intended to honour the pilot of another fighter jet that died in a crash a week ago.

The resulting fireball damaged several nearby buildings.

Libya is witnessing its worst violence since former dictator Muammar al-Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011.

The country’s divisions are deeply rooted in rivalries between Islamists and non-Islamists, as well as powerful tribal and regional allegiances between groups that quickly filled the power vacuum after Gaddafi’s was ousted. Successive transitional governments have failed to control the militias.

FIGHTING FLARES UP

Fierce clashes have erupted in recent days over Libya’s eastern city of Benghazi.

Fighting between Islamist militiamen and rival forces loyal to a renegade general killed 31 fighters on both sides, a security official said overnight.

The fighting erupted late on Monday, with forces and fighter jets belonging to General Khalifa Hifter pounding positions of Islamist militias called The Benghazi Revolutionary Shura Council, said the official.

The issue of foreign military intervention is one of the most debated in the country. Earlier this month, unknown parties carried out air strikes in Tripoli, bombing Islamist-allied militias’ positions. American officials confirmed reports that Egypt and the United Arab Emirates were behind the two air strikes.

The hours-long clashes concentrated around the city’s Benina airport and the militiamen responded with artillery, added the official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to talk to the media.

Hifter’s side lost 20 fighters while the militiamen had 11 killed, and 36 fighters in all were wounded, the official said. Several of the wounded were reported to be in critical condition.

Fighting in recent months has mostly engulfed the capital, Tripoli, and also Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city.

The militias in control of the capital, operating under an umbrella group called the Dawn of Libya, have also taken control of the US embassy compound a week after they drove out rival militias.

On Tuesday, Libya’s official news agency said calm had returned to Tripoli, with some banks resuming work and shops and bakeries reopening. Traffic also picked up in the capital and there were long lines outside gas stations. Some families who fled the fighting areas have returned to their homes, the agency said.

POLITICAL CRISIS

On Monday, Libya’s newly elected parliament asked Abdullah al-Thinni — the country’s prime minister who resigned last week — to form a new government. Al-Thinni had said after his resignation that his government had lost control of almost all state institutions and government offices to the armed Islamist militias.

The fighting forced the newly elected parliament and al-Thinni to operate in the eastern city of Tobruk.

On Tuesday, Mohammed Shouaib, the deputy head of parliament, stressed that the body did not ask for “military intervention” but for the United Nations to help Libya build its institutions, including the police and military. He was referring to an earlier decision by the parliament to call for international help in restoring order in Libya.

Shouaib was speaking in a press conference with British envoy Jonathan Powell and British ambassador Michael Aron, who were visiting Tobruk to express support to the elected parliament.

Meanwhile in Tripoli, a parallel government is in the making. Supported by Islamist allies, the so-called National Salvation government led by Omar al-Hassi and his 14-ministers won a vote of confidence. Al-Hassi was appointed by the outgoing parliament — whose mandate expired after a new parliament was elected — and assigned him to form a new government to challenge the legitimate ones in Tobruk."
"56","A man accused of attempting to rape a girl in India has been left in a critical condition after locals cut off his genitals as punishment.

The group took the law into their own hands after they found a 40-year old man pinning a young girl to the wall in the north-eastern city of Ganganagar.

After a community meeting, the vigilantes dragged the man into a nearby butchery and used a meat cleaver to cut off his penis. The remains were discarded in the street beside the man, who was suffering from severe blood loss.

One local said: ""No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,"" the Daily Mirror reports.

""We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it's time it stopped.""


She said it would ""send out a very strong message"" to possible offenders, warning them of the punishment they face.

Police were quick to condemn the attack, warning locals not to take the law into their own hands and calling for those responsible to hand themselves in.

""As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.""

The young girl was treated for shock and is receiving counselling, while the man remains in a critical condition in hospital.

Incidents of rape in India have gone up tenfold in the last 40 years, The Guardian reports, with a spate of recent attacks shocking the nation and the world. Last year a 23-year old woman died after being gang raped on a bus in the Indian capital. ·"
"59","This is the moment a group of Russians captured video footage of what they believed was a Yeti walking through the woods.

The footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later.

A team had set out in search of the mysterious creature after local television reported that it had been sighted in a remote region an hour's drive away from the city of Adygeisk.

Sighting: A team of Russians believe they have captured footage of the elusive Yeti in a remote patch of woodland

Footage shows a 'bear-like' figure covered in hair emerging from an area of snow-covered trees in the south-western Adygeya Republic before disappearing again seconds later

They said they had questioned residents at a mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen it - and on speaking to others in the area managed to secure reports of several independent sightings.

The group claim they heard the crunching of snow as they headed out to investigate before capturing footage of the creature, which they describe as covered in hair.

Afterwards, they took a plaster cast of a large footprint they said they found in the snow.

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local television said: 'The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we've seen something big and shaggy.'

Homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: 'I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house.

'Although we didn't see anyone we saw its huge footprints. They were five to six centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot.

"60","The White House is attempting to verify footage released by the Islamic State (IS) purporting to show the killing of an American journalist in retaliation for ongoing US airstrikes against its forces in Iraq.

The video circulated on Tuesday showed a masked Isis fighter beheading a kneeling man cloaked in an orange jumpsuit who is purported to be James Foley, a photojournalist who went missing in Syria in 2012. The White House said it was working to establish the video's authenticity, but if it was genuine, the US would be “appalled by the brutal murder”.

Foley has worked in a number of conflict zones in the Middle East, including Syria, Libya and Iraq. He and another journalist were working in the northern province of Idlib in Syria when they were kidnapped in November 2012 near the village of Taftanaz.

The video opened with a clip of US President Barack Obama saying he had authorised strikes in Iraq. “Obama authorises military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims,” words appear in English and Arabic on the screen. It showed black and white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying “American aggression against the Islamic State”

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife. “I call on my friends family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the US government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask says: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards the Islamic State. Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.”

Following his statement he beheads the kneeling man.

The video also shows a second man on his knees, who is named as Steven Sotloff, another American journalist, who was kidnapped in Syria in August 2013. After bringing out Sotloff, the masked executioner addresses the US President directly, saying: “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision.”

The Islamic State had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The video was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the US occupation in 2011. A Twitter account set up by Mr Foley’s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”"
"61","NORTH Korean leader Kim Jong Un is in firm control of his government but has hurt his leg, a source with access to North Korea’s leadership said yesterday, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old’s health and grip on power.

North Korea’s state media, which usually chronicles Kim’s whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3.

The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.

“He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,” the source said on condition of anonymity.

“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened.”

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.

Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source.

“Kim Jong Un is in total control,” added the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang.

North Korean officials have denied that Kim’s public absence is health-related and a United States official following North Korea said this week there were no indications that he was seriously ill or in political trouble. It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.

He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.

Speculation that Kim’s unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a TV report late last month that said he was suffering from “discomfort.”

Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit last Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.

The source with knowledge of Kim’s health said rumors of a coup were “rubbish.”

Kim was absent from a September 25 meeting of the Supreme People’s Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.

However, Kim’s name has not disappeared from state propaganda. Yesterday’s edition of the Workers’ Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page."
"62","Nigeria says it has struck a cease-fire deal with Boko Haram, raising hopes that over 200 schoolgirls who were kidnapped by the militant group will be released. But mystery continues to surround the identity of the interlocutor on the other side of the negotiations.

Nigerian officials said the deal was reached in Chad on Friday in talks with a Saudi Arabia-based Boko Haram representative named Danladi Ahmadu.

The name took many by surprise, including people who have been involved in previous negotiations with Boko Haram. “I have failed to find anyone who has ever heard of him,” BBC’s Nigeria correspondent wrote.   “We've tried verifying the authenticity of the person from sources traditionally close to Boko Haram militants and we are getting negative feedback,” the editors of Nigerian news site Sahara Reporters told The WorldPost by email.

Ahmad Salkida, a Nigerian journalist who is considered close to Boko Haram's leaders, said he does not believe Ahmadu is part of the group’s leadership or that he speaks for the group. “I challenge Danladi Ahmadu to an open debate if he has d [sic] interest of Nigeria at heart. Who is he?"" Salkida wrote on Twitter.

But Mike Omeri, the Nigerian government's spokesperson on the Boko Haram insurgency, told The WorldPost Saturday that the government is confident it has been negotiating with the right guy.

“These talks did not just happen one sunny morning ... They approached the president of Chad, and if he wasn’t confident [of Ahmadu’s identity] he wouldn’t have connected him with the president of Nigeria,” Omeri said. ""The fact that this contact comes from Nigeria’s neighbor gives us confidence.""

Chad has confirmed it is acting as a mediator in the talks to free the girls, who were kidnapped in the Nigerian village of Chibok in April. Since Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan visited Chad last month, rumors have grown that Nigeria's government was quietly negotiating the girls' release via its neighbor. It was not immediately clear how long the talks have been taking place.

Boko Haram's leadership has not commented on the cease-fire. Meanwhile, Ahmadu himself has purportedly made at least two statements in recent days. On Friday, he gave an interview with Voice of America’s Hausa-language service in which he didn’t mention the kidnapped schoolgirls and was vague on the details of the cease-fire, Agence France-Presse reported. The news agency also noted that Ahmadu referred to the militant group as Boko Haram, a name used by outsiders but not by the insurgents themselves.

On Saturday, Sahara Reporters said its correspondent in the northeastern Nigerian city of Maiduguri had obtained a CD recording of another statement by Ahamdu. This time, he was more precise.

“On the girls that we took from Chibok, all that we want before we free the girls is to get justice from the Nigerian state because there are many of our members that their business premises were destroyed, some killed and others in detention and many other oppression,” Ahmadu said, according to a translation from Hausa by Sahara Reporters. The news site’s editors said they remain skeptical about his identity.

As part of the deal, Omeri said, the talks taking place in Chad this week will address the release of the schoolgirls.

Omeri added that the militants are motivated by a wish to reintegrate into society. “They are working towards peace in order to have a chance for them to return to normal things -- for example, many have businesses, "" he said.

Asked whether Nigeria would consider releasing captured Boko Haram militants in exchange for the girls, Omeri said “every asset"" will be directed towards the girls' release. ""Everything possible is being done until the day they are freed,"" he said.

""Boko Haram want peace, they are ready for it and intend to have it implemented,"" he added.

After the cease-fire was announced, suspected Boko Haram militants continued to attack communities in northeast Nigeria, leaving several dozen dead over the weekend.

But Omeri insisted that the violence would not deter the negotiations. He suggested that militants in remote areas may not have heard about the cease-fire, or that the attacks could have been perpetrated by criminal opportunists, rather than Boko Haram members.

Boko Haram is ""deeply fractured,"" according to the risk consultancy Stratfor, quoted in Reuters Sunday. Nigeria's government had a ""difficult time identifying a Boko Haram representative who could make compromises and guarantee the entire group will observe them,"" Stratfor said.

""It is quite possible that Abuja has reached an agreement with a legitimate representative of a specific cell ... that holds the kidnapped schoolgirls captive,"" the group added.

In the kidnapped girls’ hometown, the community hardly dared to hope that the girls might be finally returned. ""We don't know how true it is until we prove it,"" said Bana Lawan, chairman of Chibok Local Government Area, told The Associated Press."
"63","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had surgery in Pyongyang in mid-September to treat fractures to both ankles and remains in hospital, a source claimed Monday.

The source, who recently visited the North, said, ""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended."" 

The source added Kim had surgery at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members, in mid-September and is now recovering there. 

The source said bodyguards have been posted around the ward and security remains tight. ""There's been a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward,"" the source added. 

One intelligence official here said Kim's official car does not appear to have left Pyongyang, so it is likely he remains in the capital. 

The official said Kim is overweight and appears to have sprained his ankles during a grueling tour of military bases and factories in Cuban heels. Kim is around 170 cm tall and has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.
There has been speculation that his obesity and binge drinking brought on gout. The official Rodong Sinmun daily recently said Kim ""labored on"" by visiting various facilities braving the hot summer weather. 

Kim missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang on Thursday. 

A government official here said, ""It's unlikely that a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People's Assembly just because he has gout.""

State TV in a rare admission on Thursday showed footage of Kim limping and admitted he is ill. South Korean intelligence also learned that a team of doctors from Europe recently went to North Korea."

McDonald’s has just announced that it will be phasing out 8 menu items the beginning of next year and most McDonald’s customers are not happy.

With McDonald’s profits tanking over the recent months, the company has had to make some tough decisions to find adequate solutions for their financial distress by shrinking menu sizes. “Our intent is to have a cleaner menu board that is easier for customers to absorb,” spokeswoman Lisa McComb said in a statement. “To do so we must simplify our current menu.

This means the end of the Big Mac, apple pie and large size menu items. Currently, the Big Mac has a whopping 550 calories and 29g of fat. The Apple pie contains 250 cal, and it would take a full 69 minute to walk that off! With that being said, those two menu items were not a tough decision for elimination.

McDonald’s is currently testing out a new version of their slim down menu in Delaware, Little Rock, Waco, Bakersfield, Macon and Knoxville. They plan a full nationwide rollout beginning February 1, 2015.

One notable “ingredient” – preservatives – might also be eliminated from the menu altogether. Mark Andrés, President of McDonald’s USA, sparked widespread speculation when he asked investors, “Why do we need to have preservatives in our food?” And then answered himself with a “We probably don’t.”

In the state of Colorado, marijuana dispensaries are big business – earning some retailers nearly $1 million per year.

Those numbers were so appealing to the KFC Corporation, they decided to incorporate a marijuana dispensary with their Colorado franchise restaurants.

Franchisees have the opportunity to expand into the business for an additional $35,000 setup fee.


 
The KFC Corporation was approved on February 3, 2015 for their Marijuana Retail Recreational Pot / Medical Marijuana Occupational Business License.

Currently, 42 of the nearly 100 KFC franchises in the state of Colorado have added this “option” to their menu.

Marijuana may be purchased only by adults 21 years or older, and a picture ID is required.

Coloradans may buy 1 ounce at a time, while out-of-state residents are limited to a quarter ounce.

Due to banking restrictions, all sales are required to be cash transactions. Prices begin around $200 and up per ounce along with a 25% marijuana tax.

Although the ad was originally posted to eBay’s career page way back in November, it has only recently come to light through an ad posted to LinkedIn. The ad says that it is looking for a dev to join eBay’s New Technology Group, which operates out of Portland with over 200 engineers.

According to the ad, the ideal candidate will “design and implement elegant solutions for the Apple Watch that will complement our core iOS eBay app.” That seems to indicate that whatever presence the eBay app has on the Apple Watch, it will tie into the core iPhone app.

What kind of functionality will the eBay Apple Watch app have? That’s up for speculation, although an alert app that lets you know when you’re about to be outbid, when your items have sold, and when a new watched search term pops up on the world’s largest internet auction site are all a good bet."

Less than two weeks after Leonardo DiCaprio broke off talks with Sony to play Steve Jobs, the studio has set its sights back on Christian Bale.

Sources say Sony is beginning negotiations with The Fighter actor, who was originally eyed to play the late Apple Computer co-founder back when David Fincher was in talks to direct. The move comes after Bale's negotiations with Fox to star in The Deep Blue Goodbye hit a roadblock. Sources say Fox was trying to include sequel options for Bale to tackle the lead role of Detective Travis McGee in what is hoped to be a franchise starter, but the actor balked. Now, talks are ongoing with Bale without sequel options, but even if a deal is reached, the actor would shoot the Jobs project before Deep Blue Goodbye.

Danny Boyle is directing the untitled Jobs film, which is based on Walter Isaacson's book and adapted by Aaron Sorkin and is one of the most anticipated biopics in recent years. Sony optioned the best-seller in 2011, around the time of Jobs' death.

"74","At least one of five Taliban militants released by the Obama administration in a controversial exchange for American soldier Bowe Bergdahl has ""attempted to reestablish contacts"" with the Taliban in Afghanistan, U.S. officials told NBC News on Thursday.

There was no indication the former prisoner, being held in Qatar, made contact with the Taliban. The officials said it is unclear whether this was an actual attempt to rejoin the Taliban militants in Afghanistan.

""We're closely monitoring the situation and see no potential threat"" from the attempted communication, a senior U.S. official said. The official could not say exactly how the former prisoner tried to reach the Taliban.

The five Taliban militants, including two top leaders, were released from the Guantanamo Bay detention facility in May. As part of the deal that led to Bergdahl's release, they had to remain in Qatar under a one-year travel ban set to end in June.

The militant who tried to reconnect with the Taliban had ""several phone calls"" with family members in Afghanistan, a senior official told NBC. There was no indication the calls, monitored by security officials, involved any ""threatening activity or planning,"" the official added.

Nevertheless, the U.S. will try to have restrictions placed on out-of-country calls though the prisoners are allowed to communicate with relatives and other visitors in Qatar.

Bergdahl was reportedly captured by the Haqqani terrorist network in Pakistan after he left a remote outpost in June 2009 and held for five years. Bergdahl could be charged with desertion."
"75","HBO is in talks with Apple over a partnership that would see its upcoming standalone web-only subscription television package available on the Apple TV, reports Michael Learmonth, writing for International Business Times. CNBC has also confirmed that Apple and HBO are in talks in the video tweet posted below.

BREAKING: Sources tell @JBoorstin that Apple & HBO are in talks for Apple TV to be a launch partner for 'HBO Now'. https://t.co/hQd9AzA3Xr— CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) March 4, 2015
Apple could potentially be one of HBO's launch partners for its web-only service, which may be called ""HBO Now."" News of HBO's web-based subscription service first surfaced in October of 2014, after HBO CEO Richard Plepler shared the company's plans at an investor presentation.

The service, aimed at cable cutters, will allow users to access HBO content without a cable subscription for a set monthly fee. With the launch of a cable-free subscription service, HBO will become the first major premium content provider to cease limiting its television and movie offerings to cable subscribers.

According to Learmonth, HBO's web-only subscription will launch in April alongside the premiere of the fifth season of Game of Thrones, which takes place on April 12. The service is said to cost $15 per month, which is roughly how much it costs to subscribe to HBO through a cable company. A partnership with Apple would allow the service to be watched on the Apple TV, much like the existing version of HBO's service, HBO Go. HBO Go is available to all existing HBO subscribers on a variety of devices like the iPad and Apple TV, but it requires an HBO subscription through a cable or satellite provider.

Cable companies like Time Warner and Comcast have long been reluctant to offer piecemeal pricing and companies like HBO have previously avoided moving away from traditional cable models in order to preserve the status quo and avoid upsetting existing revenue streams.

The introduction of HBO's service will be a major victory for cord cutters, and it could encourage other content providers to introduce similar offerings. Content providers' reluctance to shift away from traditional cable pricing models has been one of the major factors that's prevented Apple from establishing deals for its own service in the past.

"76","Border Patrol agents detain immigrants who crossed from Mexico into the United States near McAllen, Texas, June 27, 2014. The state’s Rio Grande Valley has been the epicenter of a surge illegal immigration in recent months.  Molly Hennessy-Fiske/Los Angeles Times / MCT

The Department of Homeland Security has repeatedly said that the assertion that ISIS-affiliated terrorists were arrested while crossing the U.S.-Mexico border is “categorically false and not supported by any credible intelligence or facts on the ground.”

But the vice president of the largest union representing Border Patrol agents told BuzzFeed News on Thursday that DHS — which oversees the Border Patrol — is incorrect. And he said, the incident highlights the need for more funding for the Border Patrol,

“I haven’t been able to outright confirm that it happened, but from what I have heard it sounds very credible,” said Shawn Moran, the vice-president of the National Border Patrol Council, which represents some 17,000 Border Patrol employees, “From what people have read to me, from what they say they have seen in documents, it seems pretty legit.”

Moran admitted he had not seen the document himself. He added that he did not know the name of the official who prepared the report, or what agency did that official work for, but that his “instincts told” him the official was with the Border Patrol. He also declined to tell BuzzFeed News who had told him about the report in the first place.

When asked what would be the appropriate response to the alleged incident, Moran said that the Border Patrol needs more funding and more people to do its job and prevent ISIS from entering the U.S. again.

A spokeswoman with the Department of Homeland Security declined to discuss Moran’s specific statements, but insisted that “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

Moran’s statements Thursday followed allegations from two Republican lawmakers who told BuzzFeed News on Wednesday that suspected terrorists have infiltrated the U.S.–Mexico border and as many as 10 fighters have been captured.

The persistence of these rumors may stem from the arrests in September of four people with suspected ties to terrorism that were later found to be unfounded, Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson said in a speech Thursday.

“Four individuals were arrested, their supposed link to terrorism was thoroughly investigated and checked, and in the end amounted a claim by the individuals themselves that they were members of the Kurdish Worker’s Party – an organization that is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq,” said Johnson. “Nevertheless, these individuals have been arrested for unlawful entry, they are detained, and they will be deported.”

Reports that terrorists affiliated with Islamist groups have tried to enter the United States through the southern border have circulated around the web for months, even before ISIS became a household term.

In July, for example, members of a volunteer armed militia told Breitbart News they were concerned because they had found what they thought was a “Muslim Prayer Rug” in the Arizona desert.

Thus far, the threat embodied by that alleged rug has failed to materialize."
"77","Ahmed Abdi Godane is the spiritual leader of al-Shabab

He is believed among six people killed in a U.S. airstrike on two cars near the al-Shabab stronghold of Barawe

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Kenya in September 2013 that killed 67 people

U.S. officials have not yet confirmed Godane is among the dead

U.S. drone strikes are believed to have killed the leader of the Somali terrorist group al-Shabab, who ordered the massacre at a Kenyan shopping mall last year that killed 67 people.

U.S. Intelligence officials believe Ahmed Abdi Godane was traveling in a two-car convoy Monday night near al-Shabab's main base in Barawe when American drone aircraft hit the vehicles with missiles.

Six people were killed in the attack and Somali authorities say they think Godane is among the dead - though the Pentagon said it is still awaiting confirmation.

Godane, also known as Mukhtar Abu Zubeyr, is al-Shabab's spiritual leader under whose direction the Somali militants forged an alliance with al-Qaida and became the most high-profile terrorist group in Africa.

Scroll down for video

Ahmed Abdi Godane is believed one of six people killed when a drone fired on his two-car convoy in Somalia on Monday night, though U.S. officials have not confirmed the death

Dangerous as ever: Even though al-Shabab fighters have been kicked out of the capital of Mogadishu, they have continued attacking targets throughout Africa

Under Godane's orders, the group attacked the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, killing at least 67 people a year ago this month.

The group was also responsible for a suicide bombing at a World Cup watching party in Kampala, Uganda, in 2010 that left 74 dead and 70 injured.

The U.S. has targeted planners of the bloody Westgate assault, in which four Britons and two Canadians were killed. A month after the attack, Navy SEALs landed at al-Shabab's headquarters in Barawe and attempted to capture another mastermind behind the attack.

In 2012, the U.S. government put a $7million price on Godane's head - though he has escaped justice until now.

A witness to Monday's airstrike in Somalia described ground-shaking explosions caused by the missile. Somali government and African Union forces heading to a town in the district heard what sounded like an 'earthquake' as the al-Shabab bases were hit, the governor of Somalia's Lower Shabelle region, Abdiqadir Mohamed Nor, told The Associated Press.

'There was an airstrike near Sablale. We saw something,' Nor said.

U.S. commanders said they are waiting to determine the outcome of Monday's attack.

'U.S. military forces conducted an operation in Somalia today against the al-Shabab network. We are assessing the results of the operation and will provide additional information as and when appropriate,' said Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Adm. John Kirby.

After the U.S. strike in a forest near Sablale district south of Mogadishu, masked Islamic militants in the area arrested dozens of residents they suspected of spying for the U.S. and searched nearby homes, a resident said.

Godane is believed to have ordered the Westgate Mall massacre in Nairobi, Kenya, last year that claimed 67 lives in Kenya. He also forged the groups alliance with al-Qaeda

'Mass arrests just started, everyone is being detained,' said Mohamed Ali, who lives in Sablale district. 'They even searched nearby jungles and stopped the nomads transporting milk and grass to the towns for questioning.'

The U.S. has carried out several airstrikes in Somalia in recent years.

A U.S. missile strike in January killed a high-ranking intelligence officer for al-Shabab and last October a vehicle carrying senior members of the group was hit in a U.S. strike that killed al-Shabab's top explosives expert.

The latest U.S. action comes after Somalia's government forces regained control of a high-security prison in the capital that was attacked on Sunday. Seven heavily armed suspected al-Shabab members had attempted to free other extremists held there.

Somali officials said all seven attackers, three government soldiers and two civilians were killed. Mogadishu's Godka Jilacow prison is an interrogation center for Somalia's intelligence agency, and many suspected militants are believed to be held in underground cells there. The attack started when a suicide car bomber detonated an explosives-laden vehicle at the gate of the prison and the gunmen then fought their way into the prison.

Al-Shabab attacked the mall in Nairobi last year to punish Kenya for sending troops into Somalia against the extremists. Godane said at the time that the mall attack was carried out in retaliation for the West's support for Kenya's Somalia intervention and the 'interest of their oil companies.'

Al Shabab is now mostly active in Somalia's rural regions after being ousted from the capital by African Union forces in 2011.

Somali military officials last week launched a military operation to oust al-Shabab from its last remaining bases in the southern parts of Somalia. On Saturday the militants withdrew from the town of Bulomarer, located about 110 kilometers (70 miles) south of Mogadishu, after hours of fighting."

"82","It was a heartwarming story for legions of pet owners and animal lovers around the world.

Pope Francis, talking to a distraught boy whose pet had died, declared there was a place in heaven for the creatures we share our lives with. His comment was reported this week by many news media outside Italy, with dozens of articles in the United States. It was veritable catnip to social media.

However, it turned out the pope had not made the comment.

The news stories were apparently based on a misreading of remarks Pope Francis made at his weekly general audience at the Vatican on Nov. 26 and on a comment that a past pope did make several decades ago.

Pope Paul VI, who died in 1978, once said, reportedly while comforting a child whose dog had died, ""one day we will see our animals in the eternity of Christ.""

""There is a fundamental rule in journalism. That is double-checking, and in this case it was not done,"" the Vatican's deputy spokesman, Father Ciro Benedettini, said on Saturday, when asked about how the media ran with the story.

The spokesman said he received a number of calls on the story from outside Italy on Friday and was taken by surprise because he did not recall the pope saying anything like that.

Religion News Service was among the first media to set the record straight. It said in an article published late on Friday that the error appeared to have stemmed from a piece in the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera on Nov. 27, whose headline was misleading.


The article recounted the pope's words from his general audience on Nov. 26, when the topic was the transformation of all creation into a new heaven and a new earth. It cited the remark about animals and attributed it to Paul VI, but its headline said ""The pope and animals. 'paradise is open to all creatures.'""

The New York Times, which ran a story on Thursday about the purported comment by Francis, acknowledged its mistake, saying in a correction on Friday that it had misattributed the remark by Paul VI to the current pope.

Asked about the mistake, a spokeswoman for the Times quoted Michael Slackman, managing editor of international news, as saying, ""The correction in The Times notes that the specific content and wording were wrong in the article. However, the pope did in fact make comments suggesting heaven is open to animals.""

In his Nov. 26 remarks, the pope referred to heaven saying ""the Sacred Scripture teaches us that the fulfillment of this marvelous plan cannot but affect all that which surrounds us and which emerged from the thought and the heart of God."" He did not refer specifically to animals in his remarks.

On its website, CNN also corrected its story, noting the misattribution and saying it was unclear what Francis believes about pets going to heaven. A spokeswoman for CNN had no immediate comment.

Reuters did not publish a story on the remarks erroneously attributed to Francis.

WHAT DOES THE POPE THINK ABOUT PETS?

As for what Francis does think about animals, he has not spoken much about them in public, but Benedettini said that from the general tone of his speeches and gestures ""it is clear that he is in spiritual harmony with all of creation.""

The spokesman said the pope was preparing an encyclical that will deal in part with the environment and recalled that a group that looks after stray dogs once brought the animals to his general audience and the pope was pleased.

When he made a Christmas season visit to a Rome parish last year, Francis willingly let a young girl place a lamb on his shoulders as a shepherd would carry it. The pope once told priests that a good pastor should know not only the names of his parishioners but also the names of their dogs, Benedettini said.

Recent popes have said different things about the possible spiritual side of animals.

In 1990, Pope John Paul implied that animals had souls because they too were created from the breath of God. In 2008, former Pope Benedict upset some animal lovers when he said only humans were ""called to eternity.""

“I feel happy and relieved. And excited. And really interested to see what’s in this box,” she said Thursday night, after posing for a selfie with the capsule for her mom. The extrication took more than seven hours and involved about a dozen workers.


The original contents of the time capsule were first placed in 1795 by Governor Samuel Adams, Paul Revere, and William Scollay in a ceremony that started in downtown Boston and proceeded to the State House, according to historical accounts. It was unearthed during emergency repairs to the foundation in 1855 and then buried again, and had not seen daylight until it emerged on Thursday.

“Hopefully there will be no damage and we will be able to observe the artifacts that trace us back to the history not only just of this building, but of our Commonwealth and our country,” said Secretary of State William Galvin, who was on hand for the capsule’s first appearance in more than 150 years.

The capsule is believed to include a collection of silver and copper coins dating from between 1652 and 1855; an engraved silver plate; newspapers; the seal of the Commonwealth; cards; and a title page from the Massachusetts Colony Records, according to Meghan Kelly, a spokeswoman for the Executive Office of Administration and Finance.

Hatchfield, who is head of Objects Conservation at the Museum of Fine Arts, said the corroded copper alloy box that holds the collection was undamaged by the removal process, and appeared to be in good shape. It was a little smaller than a cigar box and, she said, heavier than she expected.

The box was taken by State Police escort to the Museum of Fine Arts, where Hatchfield said it will be X-rayed to determine the contents. There was some concern, Galvin said, that there may be some damage to some of the coins, which may have been washed in acid before the box was reburied in 1855.

“It will be opened probably sometime next week,” said Galvin. The contents will be examined, he said, but the time capsule will not remain unburied. “Ultimately it will be put back in the box and ultimately back in the stone.”

Galvin said officials have not yet decided whether they will add any objects to the capsule before re-burying it. The capsule was discovered during the course of a water infiltration investigation at the State House, which identified the corner where it was hidden as an area of concern.

It is believed to be one of the oldest time capsules in the state, according to Kelly. In October, a century-old time capsule was opened after it was removed from its perch in the head of a golden lion statue that had sat atop the Old State House in downtown Boston. Its contents included sealed letters, photographs, and newspaper articles in near-perfect condition.

On Thursday, excavation of the State House time capsule began at about 9 a.m., with workers unwedging the stone block from the corner of the building and propping it up on blocks of wood so Hatchfield could slide underneath. The block was not flipped upside down, said Hatchfield, because she did not want to risk dislodging any of the contents.

From about 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., Hatchfield tapped away at the block, taking periodic breaks to warm up away from the whipping wind and snow. Workers brought her a space heater. The plaster that sealed the box in, she said, was much harder than she anticipated.

As she worked, tiny coins fell out of the plaster. During the 1855 reburial, public officials threw the coins in for good luck. Michael Comeau, executive director of the State Archives, said they appeared to be silver.

As the day wore on, Hatchfield used a small circular saw and a drill to try to free the capsule, and several times, she appeared to think she was close, only to have the box remain stuck. It was the most physically challenging conservation job she has ever done, she said.

“I have been privileged to spend all of my working life handling incredibly precious and important objects, and it is very exciting every single time,” said Hatchfield. “The sense of continuation of history that you get by entering a museum or historic site, but also by having it in your hands, is incredibly rewarding and enriching. And it gives meaning to a lot of people.”"
"89","EXTREMISTS fighting for the Islamic State (IS) have started launching bombs packed with live SCORPIONS.

Bomb canisters – packed with the venemous arachnids – are being blasted into towns and villages to scatter scorpions and incite panic, a British military expert has revealed.

Former head of chemical and biological weapons for NATO and the British army Hamish de Bretton-Gordon described the arachnid attacks as ""madness"".

He told The Daily Mirror: ""It’s madness.

""IS have improvised devices to launch them.

""They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.

""Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.""

The 24in scorpion bombs are not used for mass casualties but instead designed to maximise the terrorist group's ""psychological impact"" on the villagers.

Mr Bretton-Gordon, who returned from Baghdad last week where he had been advising security forces, added: ""The main thing is creating fear.""

Senior officials in Iraq have reported scorpions being used against civilian targets in northern parts of the country.

There are 25 known species of scorpion with venom capable of killing a human being.

References to 'scorpion bombs' have been found dating back to 198 AD.

The bizarre biological weapon was created when Iraqis began pouring scorpions into ceramic pots to hurl at the Roman armies storming the fortress city of Hatra.

The scorpion-filled weapons have even been credited by some with ending the 20 day siege on the desert city.

"91","The dedicated pet owner initially refused to pay for the procedure to save the 3-inch fish at Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk, but quickly changed his mind.

A British man forked out $460 to save the life of his goldfish — after it became constipated.

The dedicated owner took his blocked-up 3-inch pet to a vet after realizing it was struggling to pass waste, reports the Norfolk Daily Eastern Press.

He was stunned to be told that the delicate operation needed to solve the problem would cost $460.

Shocked at the high cost, he initially refused to give Toll Barn Veterinary Center in Norfolk the go-ahead.

But the man, who has not been named, had a change of heart and returned just 10 minutes later to give them the green light.

Vet Faye Bethell administered anesthetic to the fish, which was believed to be 2-years and 10-months old.

"93","A Chinese woman spent an entire week in a KFC eating fried chicken wings after being dumped by her boyfriend because she ‘needed time to think’.

Lovesick Tan Shen, 26, from Chengdu, in China’s southwest Sichuan Province, went to the fast food chain in search of some comfort food to get over the break-up.

But seven days later Tan was still ordering chicken wings with a side of extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home.

She even phoned in sick to work to stay at the restaurant.

Tan said: ‘I was walking around feeling miserable and decided to stop off at the KFC at the train station.

'I hadn’t planned on staying there long, I just wanted some chicken wings.

'But once I got in there and started eating I decided I needed time to think.

'I didn’t want to go back to my apartment because it was full of memories of him. So I stayed.'

After a few days employees at the chicken shop began to worry about Tan.

For seven days Tan ordered chicken wings with extra large fries at the KFC near a train station by her home

Tan said she stayed at the fast food restaurant for so long because she 'needed time to think'

Worker Jiang Li Lung, 22, said: 'We work in shifts here and the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so we get a lot of people coming through.

'At first no one really noticed her.

'But after a few days I began thinking she looked really familiar.

'Then I realised we had been serving her for the past three days and that she hadn’t actually left.

'When we asked her if she was ok, she said she was and just needed time to think.

'And then asked for another box of chicken wings with extra large fries.'

Tan even called in sick to her work so she could spent time at the KFC recovering from her break-up

He said the Tan was doing no harm eating her way through boxes of chicken so they let her stay.

He added: 'She was after all a paying customer, even if a bit of an odd one.'

Tan decided she had had enough when local media turned up after a week at the KFC. And, unsurprisingly, she was starting to get sick of the taste of chicken.

'I decided the best thing to do would be to leave the city and go back to my parents.

It was only after a week that Tan decided she was 'sick of the taste of chicken' and she went home

'I had already told work I was off sick, so phoned them and said I was leaving.

'And I was getting sick of the taste of chicken so there was no point in staying there anymore.'

She then boarded the next train to her parents' home in Quingdao city in east China’s Shandong Province and left.

Waitress Jiang Li Lung said: 'I guess we kind of miss her. It certainly made work more interesting.'

"95","Kabul: A recent footage of a sniper bullet hitting a US marine on the helmet during a helicopter raid in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, has gone viral on social media.

The importance of wearing a helmet when on the field of battle has been perfectly illustrated in a video uploaded to YouTube by a US marine.

In the video, three marines are seen to move through a bunker in search of a source of gunfire. As they come near to the exit point, a bullet suddenly bounces off the Kevlar helmet of the middle soldier.

The three men then quickly retreat to the back of the building to inspect the damage to the soldier's helmet. After ascertaining that the Marine is unharmed, they regroup to consider their options.

Afghanistan veteran Sam Arnold reportedly said that the video was shot while ""conducting a joint helicopter raid in the Now Zad district, Helmand Province in 2013"". The footage was uploaded to YouTube last month, and has since received just under 200,000 views."
"99","Shane Smith, the sometimes controversial but always press-friendly CEO of Vice Media, has found another way to make news: reportedly spend $300,000 on a Las Vegas meal.

On a Tuesday earnings call, MGM Resorts International boasted that someone had recently spent $300,000 taking some acquaintances to dinner at one of its restaurants. On Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that it was Smith.

The Vice co-founder spent the large sum of money at Bellagio's Prime Steakhouse when he was in Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show last month, Bloomberg reported.

Smith can certainly afford to pick up the tab after A+E Networks and Technology Crossover Ventures each invested $250 million in Vice for 10 percent stakes, on top of a $70 million investment from Rupert Murdoch's 21st Century Fox.

Vice fashions itself a cutting-edge media company that eschews tradition and on occasion even courts danger. It made worldwide news when it took former NBA player Dennis Rodman and the Harlem Globetrotters to North Korea to hang out with Kim Jong Un.

Smith has hinted at an IPO for Vice and guesses it could be worth $20 billion, likely an exaggeration, but an IPO of practically any magnitude would probably make him a billionaire.

A Vice spokesman told The Hollywood Reporter that Smith won ""well north of"" $300,000 while playing blackjack during his trip to Las Vegas and it was the money from that windfall that funded the dinner.

Still, the reveal of the $300,000 dinner might cause Smith some angst, given that he is being accused in some circles of living the good life while underpaying Vice staffers. 

""A company as successful as Vice should be paying decent wages. Vice doesn't,"" says a recent report from Gawker. ""The company pays shitty wages to low-level employees, compensating them instead with the sheer coolness of working for Vice Media.""

Then again, at a company party in December, Smith gave each full-time employee an envelope with $1,500 cash inside, amounting to a $1 million expenditure, according to insiders.

"104","NO AMOUNT of money is enough for Led Zeppelin front man Robert Plant to get the band back together.

The 66-year-old singer walked away from a 35-date tour that would have paid the rock group nearly $924 million — ripping up the contract in front of stunned promoters, The Mirror newspaper reported.

British tycoon Sir Richard Branson had planned to reunite the Stairway to Heaven rockers and promoters had even gotten the green light from the other band members.

The mega deal would have paid Plant, Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones roughly $346 million apiece, before taxes, according to The Mirror.

Group members lobbied hard for Plant to join in but he wouldn’t change his mind.

“They have tried to talk him round but there is no chance,” a source close to the group told The Mirror. “His mind is made up and that’s that.”

A big payday would have also gone to Jason Bonham, 48, the son of late drummer John Bonham.

The 35 shows would have been split between London, Berlin and a site in New Jersey, according to The Mirror.

“Jimmy, John and Jason signed up immediately,” the source said. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it. When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

"105","As Apple gears up to launch the Apple Watch in April this year, Tim Cook while talking to an employee at the Apple Store spilled some extra information about the wearable before the launch. He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. ""Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"" he explains.

"107","Never fear, Banksy fans: the infamous street-artist has not been unmasked, despite frenzied reports on American websites.

Online news sites were subject to a hoax on Friday from US ‘media troll extaordinaire’ Paul Horner.

Sites Complex, Death and Taxes, and Jezebel published online stories stating that Paul Horner, 39, had been identified as the street-artist known as Banksy, and had been arrested by British police in Watford.

Horner is in fact editor of the cunningly-named Super Official News website, where he makes statements such as: “Until then just remember, if it’s on the internet it must be true”, and that “Paul Horner is an American hero.”

Website NationalReport said that “London Police Chief Lyndon Edwards” had held a press conference unmasking Banksy after the arrest - but according to the Met, no such officer exists. However, there is a dairy farmer called Lyndon Edwards.

Other Banksy pretenders incude,‘cap man’ in New York, 2013; Robin Gunningham in Bristol, 2008; Mr Brainwash in 2010; and Rose Biggin, an 89-year-old from Camden, North London, who was touted as the elusive street-artist. The pensioner said of her “I’m Spartacus” moment: “It sure does help to pass the time.”

Even a Battersea charity shop got in on the act – earlier in October someone from the Fara shop on Northcote Road not pretending to be the artist painted a Banksy-style mural and tweeted it soon after."
"108","WASHINGTON -- Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson shot down claims on Thursday that a ""porous"" U.S. southern border is allowing terrorists, Ebola and a surge of unaccompanied minors into the country, despite claims to the contrary by some politicians.

Johnson tried to dispel rumors and dial back fears during a speech at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saying there have been improvements to border security. He said the number of unaccompanied minors apprehended in fiscal year 2014 was 68,434 -- considerably lower than a projection of 90,000. Claims that four terrorists had crossed the border were false, he said, and the government is intensifying efforts to keep Ebola out of the U.S.

But that's not always what people are hearing from politicians or reading in the news, he said.

""Those of us in public office, and in the media –- whether in describing the border, ISIL or Ebola -- owe the public informed, careful, and responsible dialogue, not overheated rhetoric that is certain to feed the flames of fear, anxiety and suspicion,"" Johnson said. ISIL, the terrorist group that calls itself the Islamic State, also is called ISIS.

Recent criticism of the Obama administration over border security has stoked fears over ISIS and Ebola, particularly by Republicans campaigning for November elections. Former Sen. Scott Brown (R-Mass.), now running for Senate in New Hampshire, said on Thursday that the border needed to be secured to prevent the spread of diseases into the country. Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday that ""at least"" 10 members of the Islamic State were apprehended crossing the U.S.-Mexico border, a claim DHS said was false. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) has said that four men with ties to terrorism were apprehended along the border.

Johnson said the four individuals were investigated and found to be members of the Kurdish Worker's Party, which he said ""is actually fighting against ISIL and defended Kurdish territory in Iraq."" The men remain in detention for unlawful entry, he said. (Chaffetz, for his part, continued to maintain after Johnson's speech that the men are terrorists, according to interview with CBS News.)

On Ebola, Johnson said the government is ""heavily engaged"" and is ""enhancing our Ebola screening of air passengers from the three affected African countries, and we are continually evaluating whether more is appropriate.""

""We very definitely in this country have the capability to deal with the Ebola virus,"" he said.

Johnson touted border security improvements, but said DHS was still working to improve policies on transparency and internal agency coordination. One change in DHS policy, however, has been receiving considerable pushback from immigration advocates: the increased practice of holding families in detention. The government has expanded facilities for detaining families -- largely mothers with children, many of them seeking asylum -- over the past few months, and plans to add more space.

Greg Chen of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, which has been critical of family detention, asked Johnson during a question and answer period after the speech why the government is expanding family detention when many of the women and children being held are seeking asylum and have fled horrific violence.

Johnson said that given the increase this year in families crossing the border -- even though the numbers have dropped recently -- DHS needed to make sure it could detain them.

""We believe it's necessary to build more of that capability in the event we have another spike like we had last summer,"" he said.

Although Johnson acknowledged the influx of migrants over the past year was a ""setback,"" he said there have been improvements in border security, from more resources focused on patrol to fewer border-crossings.

""In recent years, the total number of those who attempt to cross our southwest border has declined dramatically, while the percentage of those who are apprehended has gone up,"" he said. ""Put simply, it’s now much harder to cross our border and evade capture than it used to be -– and people know that."""
"109","There is no end to Apple’s woes when it comes to the iPhone 6

Forget #bendgate, iPhone 6 Plus users have discovered a new woe to add to their list of complaints, and it already has its own hashtag: #hairgate.

After reports that Apple’s new handset bends if enough pressure is applied to it, users are now taking to Twitter to claim that the smartphone is catching hairs from people’s heads and beards and pulling them out.

“I’m concerned about my iPhone 6 Plus, keeps yanking out my hair when I’m making a call,” an anonymous user wrote in a community post on 9to5mac.com.

According to Twitter users, hairs get stuck in the fine seam between the glass and the aluminium on the new handsets.

When the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus were first released, numerous pictures of the handsets that had been unintentionally bent appeared on Twitter.

While Apple says it has only received a handful of official complaints about the issue, it is thought that the new phones are susceptible to being bent because the iPhone 6 Plus is so much larger than previous phones.

At the time, Apple said that with “normal use” a bend in the iPhone should be “extremely rare,” and that the new handsets feature “steel/titanium inserts to reinforce stress locations and use the strongest glass in the industry”."
"110","As a series of ex-soldiers come forward to criticize Brian Williams for his ‘stolen valor’ Iraq war story, it is being reported that top level executives at NBC News had known the tale was fake and had been begging the newscaster for years to stop repeating it.

Williams is at a center of a media firestorm after he was found out for embellishing an old war story about being in a helicopter hit by a grenade during the Iraq war in 2003.

The newscaster acted swiftly on Wednesday night to attempt to diffuse the situation by apologizing during his Nightly News show, but since then a series of ex-soldiers have come forward to criticize Williams ‘half-hearted’ apology.

Brian Williams is at the center of a media firestorm over his embellished war story and now it transpires that NBC News executives - and Tom Brokaw - had known for years that the story was false

To make matters worse there are also now reports that senior executives at NBC News, including legendary anchor Tom Brokaw who Williams replaced in 2004, knew the story was false.

‘Tom Brokaw and [former NBC News President] Steve Capus knew this was a false story for a long time and have been extremely uncomfortable with it,’ an insider told the New York Post.

Now Brokaw, 74, has had it and wants Williams fired, the Post claims.

Senior executives had in the past asked Williams to stop telling the story in public, reports Variety.

Despite his credibility being called into question, Williams still took the anchor’s seat for his Nightly News broadcast on Thursday evening but unlike on Wednesday he didn't address the issue during the broadcast.

'Brokaw wants Williams’ head on a platter. He is making a lot of noise at NBC that a lesser journalist or producer would have been immediately fired or suspended for a false report,' said the source.

Retraction: NBC anchor Brian Williams has been forced to admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter hit and forced down by enemy fire during the 2003 invasion of Iraq, as he claimed in a broadcast on Friday, pictured

However a separate source says that isn't going to happen. 'He is not going to be suspended or reprimanded in any way. He has the full support of NBC News,' said the source.

On Thursday the pilot of the army chinook that was attacked by rocket-propelled grenades told the Omaha World-Herald that he had contacted NBC News not long after their initial broadcast. Don Helus said he saw Williams’ initial report not long after its original broadcast after someone emailed him a clip.

NBC’s Tom Brokaw introduced the report with the words: 'Our colleague Brian Williams is back in Kuwait City tonight after a close call in the skies over Iraq.'

Helus said he contacted Williams’ producer and asked for a retraction, but didn't get a reply.

'My crew was a little upset about that - somebody trying to make a claim to inflate their career,' Helus said.

Williams was forced to apologize on air and on Facebook on Wednesday and admit that he wasn't aboard a helicopter that was hit, but had been traveling in a separate aircraft more than half an hour behind that landed without incident.

'He was actually on my aircraft and we came in behind [the other helicopter] about 30-45 minutes later,' Sgt. 1st Class Joseph Miller, the flight engineer on the helicopter that carried the journalists, wrote on Facebook after NBC shared a link to Williams' story.

Williams pictured in Iraq in 2003 with Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack: In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday, Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error

'He had the audacity to tell me the whole thing was like 'Saving Private Ryan' and that the whole army would be out looking for him. I called him an idiot in front of his camera crew and he didn't come back to my bird for the next three days.'

Pate Butler, another soldier, confirmed on Facebook: 'He flew with the Savannah birds in a totally different flight. Never was shot at. That aircraft was out of Germany and we were all in that flight.'

Lance Reynolds, another soldier who had actually been on the 159th Aviation Regiment's Chinook that was hit, also lashed out at Williams on Facebook.

'Sorry dude, I don't remember you being on my aircraft,' he wrote. 'I do remember you walking up about an hour after we had landed to ask me what had happened.

'Then I remember you guys taking back off in a different flight of Chinooks from another unit and heading to Kuwait to report your 'war story' to the Nightly News.

'The whole time we were still stuck in Iraq trying to repair the aircraft and pulling our own Security.'

Speaking to Stars and Stripes, Reynolds recalled how he had been aboard the helicopter when it was hit by two rocket-propelled grenades and small arms fire.

The damaged Chinook made a rolling landing at an Iraqi airfield, skidded off the runway and came to a stop in the desert. Reynolds and other crew members were unhurt.

Called out: Lance Reynolds, left, and Pate Butler, right, who were both part of the crews flying that day, said that Williams had not been aboard their damaged helicopter and expressed their anger at his lies

Anger: The day after Williams' report, Reynolds responded to the story on NBC NIghtly News' Facebook and said that he remembered things rather differently

Another man, Joseph Miller, who claimed to be on Williams' aircraft at the time said he had been 'calling him out on this for a long time with no response'

'It was something personal for us that was kind of life-changing for me,' he told Stars and Stripes.

'I know how lucky I was to survive it. It felt like a personal experience that someone else wanted to participate in and didn't deserve to participate in.'

When Williams approached him and took photos of the damaged aircraft, Reynolds said he dismissed the level of danger because he didn't want his wife to see a news report about it.

'I wanted to tell her myself everything was all right before she got news of this happening,' he said.

Another man on the downed aircraft, Mike O'Keeffe, said he had long been bothered by Williams' false claims.

'Over the years it faded,' he said, 'and then to see it last week it was - I can't believe he is still telling this false narrative.'

O'Keeffe added that he was satisfied with Williams' apology and didn't want to push the issue any further or 'kick the guy when he is down'.

Other soldiers have accused Williams of being misleading in his apology and continuing to imply details that are false.

Denial: Williams denied that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor' in a message he posted on Wednesday

Since the 2003 incident, Williams' Chinook story has been recounted countless times and gradually the reporter's role seems to have grown.

NBC reported the incident on March 26, 2003, with the headline, 'Target Iraq: Helicopter NBC's Brian Williams Was Riding In Comes Under Fire.'

However when the incident was reported the next day by the New York Daily News it stated that a 'chopper was hit and forced to land. Then the one carrying Williams landed.'

Three days later USA Today carried a similar report that stated: 'NBC's Brian Williams was stranded in the Iraqi desert for three days after a Chinook helicopter ahead of his was attacked by a man who fired a rocket-propelled grenade.

'The grenade just missed, but it forced the group to make an emergency landing. Luckily, a U.S. tank platoon was there and surrounded the helicopters, killing four Iraqis.'

In a 2007 entry from his blog Williams recounts how he was part of a 'flotilla of four twin-rotor Chinook helicopters'.

'Some men on the ground fired an RPG through the tail rotor of the chopper flying in front of ours.

'There was small arms fire. … All four choppers dropped their heavy loads and landed quickly and hard on the desert floor,' he recalled.

By the next year Williams was claiming on his blog that 'all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire.'

'The Chinook helicopter flying in front of ours (from the 101st Airborne) took an RPG to the rear rotor, as all four of our low-flying Chinooks took fire,' he wrote.

'We were forced down and stayed down -- for the better (or worse) part of 3 days and 2 nights.'

The tale takes a more dramatic twist during a 2013 appearance on The Late Show With David Letterman. By now Williams is recalling that two helicopter were hit - including his.

'Two of our four helicopters were hit by ground fire including the one I was in,' he told Letterman.

Then during his report on January 30, Williams once again told an inaccurate version of events so that now 'the helicopter we were travelling in was forced down after being hit by an RPG.'

For example, army flight crews told Stars and Stripes that Williams implied he was flying with the same company that the downed helicopter belonged to - but he was actually flying with a different company in a different direction, and only linked to the unit by radio.

He also suggested that his aircraft was forced to land because of the attack, but soldiers said it was landed due to deteriorating weather conditions.

After Williams' apology, there were cries for him to be terminated.

'Brian Williams has to go,' Brent Bozell, the founder and president of the Media Research Center, wrote on Twitter. 'NBC's credibility is completely shot.'

The Nightly News anchor has often repeated the war story over the past 12 years about how the aircraft he was on was forced down by enemy fire.

He repeated his old war story on Friday when he presented a segment about a public tribute at a hockey game in New York for Command Sgt. Major Tim Terpack, a retired soldier who had provided security for the grounded helicopters.

During the report, Williams went further and said that the aircraft he was on had actually been hit - and the soldiers expressed their anger on Facebook afterwards.

'I would not have chosen to make this mistake,' Williams told Stars and Stripes. 'I don't know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another.'

On the Nightly News broadcast on Wednesday evening, Williams told viewers that his mistake was a 'bungled attempt' to honor a soldier who had helped protect him.

'I made a mistake in recalling the events of 12 years ago. I want to apologize,' he said.

In a lengthy Facebook post on Wednesday Williams admitted his mistake and blamed the 'fog of memory over 12 years' for his error.

'I feel terrible about making this mistake, especially since I found my OWN WRITING about the incident from back in '08, and I was indeed on the Chinook behind the bird that took the RPG in the tail housing just above the ramp,' he wrote.

'Because I have no desire to fictionalize my experience (we all saw it happened the first time) and no need to dramatize events as they actually happened, I think the constant viewing of the video showing us inspecting the impact area - and the fog of memory over 12 years - made me conflate the two, and I apologize.'

Williams went on to strenuously deny that he was 'trying to steal anyone's valor'.

'I was and remain a civilian journalist covering the stories of those who volunteered for duty. This was simply an attempt to thank Tim, our military and Veterans everywhere -- those who have served while I did not.'

All the credit: After his apology, Twitter users joked about Williams inserting himself in other historic events

One of the top trending topics on Twitter on Wednesday night was #BrianWilliamsMisremembers.

'#BrianWilliamsMisremembers and then I said look Woodward you and Bernstein are in way over your head,time to follow a real man..lets do this,' tweeted one person.

'And I just knew we could make a better portable music player. Called it the iPod.' #BrianWilliamsMisremembers,' wrote another.

Williams appeared nonplussed about the scandal on Wednesday evening as he enjoyed a New York Rangers game with his good friend Tom Hanks

"112","The man who scaled the White House fence this month actually ran through the building into the East Room, much farther than the Secret Service initially disclosed.

The intruder overpowered a Secret Service officer posted near the door before penetrating deep into the mansion’s main floor, the Washington Post reported:

An alarm box near the front entrance of the White House designed to alert guards to an intruder had been muted at what officers believed was a request of the usher’s office, said a Secret Service official who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The female officer posted inside the front door appeared to be delayed in learning that the intruder, Omar Gonzalez, was about to burst through. Officers are trained that, upon learning of an intruder on the grounds, often through the alarm boxes posted around the property, they must immediately lock the front door.

After barrelling past the guard immediately inside the door, Gonzalez, who was carrying a knife, dashed past the stairway leading a half-flight up to the first family’s living quarters. He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

The Secret Service initially indicated Gonzalez was tackled just inside the main entrance of the mansion, saying he was “physically apprehended after entering the White House North Portico doors.”

"114","A TEXAN plumber is getting death threats after his old truck — still bearing his name — was tweeted on the front line by Islamic jihadists in Syria.

Mark Oberholtzer’s former Ford F-250 pick-up truck, complete with anti-aircraft gun, was used in a propaganda stunt by Supporters of the Religion Front (Jabhat Ansar al-Deen) in the Syrian civil war.

IS EXPLAINED: How it fits into Syria and Iraq

Subsequently his company Mark-1 Plumbing — the name emblazoned on the pick-up truck in Syria — has been bombarded with hate calls at the office in Texas City, Texas.

“A few of the people are really ugly,” he told Galveston Daily News.

“People think you are aiding and abetting terrorists.

“We have a secretary here, she’s scared to death. We all have families. We don’t want no problems.

“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said.

Oberholtzer has run the company for 32 years and said he took the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He believed that the company would remove the decal off the vehicle before sale.

“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer told Galveston Daily News. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”

Oberholtzer told CBS News that he had hired a lawyer to make Twitter remove the posting.

A spokesman for AutoNation told KHOU 11 News that the truck went to auction. It has probably had different owners since the auction before ending up in the hands of Islamic terrorists.

"117","Reasons cited for his mysterious disappearance range from ill health through an addiction to cheese to him being placed under house arrest.
Now the latest explanation for Kim Jong Un's conspicuous absence is that he has simply injured his leg.  
A source with access to the secretive North's leadership today insisted the leader is in firm control of his government, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's health and grip on power.
North Korea's state media, which usually chronicles Kim's whereabouts in great detail, has not made any mention of his activities since he attended a concert with his wife on September 3. 
The source said that Kim hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises.
He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest

He IS Un-well: The North Korean leader has not been seen in public for more than a month because he pulled a tendon while exercising with his generals, a source with access to the dictatorship has said, playing down speculation over the 31-year-old's grip on power after claims he had been placed under house arrest
'He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part too. 
'They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon,' the source told Reuters on condition of anonymity.
'He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. 
He limped around in the beginning but the injury worsened,' the source said.

Kim, who has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July, which would imply he may have aggravated an earlier injury.
Kim needs about 100 days to recuperate, said the source, whose information could not be independently verified.
'Kim Jong Un is in total control,' said the source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing.

Friday is the 69th anniversary of the founding of North Korea's Workers' Party, an event Kim has marked in the past two years with a post-midnight visit to the Pyongyang mausoleum where the bodies of his father and grandfather are interred.
If Kim does not turn up, it could fuel speculation over the state of his health and whether he may have been sidelined in a power struggle, experts said.
'The longer he remains out of the public eye, the more uncertainty about him, and the status of his regime, will grow,' said Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the U.S.-Korea Institute at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies in Washington. 
North Korean officials have denied that Kim's public absence since early September is health-related and a U.S. official following North Korea said this week there were no indications he was seriously ill or in political trouble.
It remains unclear why a leg injury would keep Kim out of the public eye for so long, although this is not the first time he has been missing from public view.

In June 2012, six months after coming to power, state media failed to report on or photograph him for 23 days.
He re-surfaced the next month at a dolphinarium.
Speculation that Kim's unusually long absence from public view may be due to ill health was fuelled by a North Korean TV report late last month that said he was suffering from 'discomfort'.
Some Pyongyang watchers also suggest that Kim may have been sidelined in a power struggle, a scenario they say was reinforced by the unexpected visit on Saturday of a high-level delegation to the closing ceremony of the Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea.
Another interpretation of that visit holds that it was meant to convey stability in Pyongyang.
The source with knowledge of Kim Jong Un's health said rumours of a coup were 'rubbish'.
'It would have to be a very subtle coup indeed not to disrupt international travel plans,' said Andray Abrahamian of the Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based NGO running a programme for North Koreans in Southeast Asia.
North Korea is a hereditary dictatorship centred on the ruling Kim family. Kim's sister, Kim Yo Jong, is known to have an official role within the ruling party. His brother, Kim Jong Chol, and his estranged half-brother are not in the public eye.
Kim was absent from a Sept. 25 meeting of the Supreme People's Assembly, or parliament, the first he has not attended since coming to power three years ago.
However, Kim's name has not disappeared from state propaganda.
Thursday's edition of the Workers' Party newspaper, the Rodong Sinmun, carried three letters to Kim from overseas allies on its front page, and has reported on returning athletes from the Asian Games who thanked 'the Marshal' for his support during the competition.
Abrahamian said it was unlikely Kim had been usurped.
'Kim Jong Un has always shared power with other key figures and even if the internal balance of power has shifted, it is unlikely that they would want to remove him, given his unmatchable symbolic value. Again, though, everyone is guessing,' he said."

Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City has been flooded with calls after the picture appeared on Twitter, The Galveston County Daily News reported.

The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist group Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report.

The photo shows a black pickup truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.

Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned the company for 32 years, said he traded that truck at an AutoNation dealership three years ago and has no idea how it ended up in Syria. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this vehicle, believing AutoNation would remove it.

""They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn't do it,"" Oberholtzer said. ""How it ended up in Syria, I'll never know.""

Oberholtzer said his business has received a thousand calls and faxes this week about the photo.

""A few of the people are really ugly,"" he said.

Oberholtzer said he just wanted people to know the vehicle was no longer his.

""I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,"" he said.

Attorney Lopa Blumenthal says the recording was made during a video chat. The audio captures what seem like 10 gunshot sounds—an initial group of six, then a pause, then four more. An autopsy of Brown's body performed at his family's request by an experienced forensic pathologist named Michael Baden indicated Brown was hit by at least six shots.

Eyewitness Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's, has said that officer Darren Wilson fired several shots at Brown after Brown had turned toward him and raised his hands. The Baden autopsy indicated that Brown had been shot exclusively in the front of his body.

"121","Claim: Deandre Joshua was murdered after testifying before a grand jury in Ferguson.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, December 2014]

Deandre Joshua, 20 was murdered after testifying to a grand jury in the ferguson, MO case. Supposedly he was found not far from where Brown's body was & he was covered in lighter fluid. It was a post I saw on FB & just wondered if it was true.

Origins: Shortly after a 20-year-old man named Deandre Joshua was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, on 24 November 2014, rumors started circulating around the Internet connecting the young man's murder to the non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson in the controversial shooting death of Michael Brown.

The details of Joshua's death are gruesome. According to the Washington Post, Deandre was shot once in the head and then burned inside his car. The incident occurred on the same night protesters took to the streets of Ferguson to protest the grand jury's decision not to indict Darren Wilson. These circumstances, coupled with the fact that Joshua was a friend of Dorian Johnson, who was with Mike Brown on the night of his death, led many to believe Joshua's murder was in some way connected to Wilson's non-indictment:

This is Deandre Joshua. This 20 year old man testified in the Grand Jury case against Darren Wilson. He was shot and killed on Tuesday. His body was found, with lighter fluid all over it, not far from where Darren Wilson killed Michael Brown. Why are broken windows on the front page of our news, and not his face?

However, there is no documentation Deandre Joshua testified before the grand jury. According to the Boston Globe , names of the witnesses were kept secret, and anyone who disclosed that information would face a misdemeanor charge. Additionally, Joshua's family and friends told the New York Times he was nowhere near the scene when Mike Brown was shot and killed, and prosecutors confirmed he was not a grand jury witness:

According to family members, friends and law-enforcement officials, however, Joshua was nowhere near Canfield Drive when Brown was killed during a confrontation with Wilson on Aug. 9 and couldn't have witnessed the shooting. And McCulloch's office, which remained tight-lipped about the Wilson investigation, confirmed that Joshua didn't offer testimony during the proceedings.

""He was not a witness,"" said Ed Magee, a spokesman for the county prosecutor.

Deandre Joshua did not witness the shooting of Michael Brown, nor did he testify before the grand jury. The only connection that Joshua had to the case was that he was a childhood friend of Dorian Johnson (who did witness the shooting):

As of 2 December 2014, Deandre Joshua's death is still under investigation by police. It is unclear who killed Joshua or why they did so, but it is clear is Joshua's death was not retaliation for grand jury testimony in the Brown case.""

ISIS sympathisers took to social media to identify the 'cub fighter' by his alleged nom de guerre Abu Ubaidah, adding that both he and his father were killed during clashes in Syria in recent weeks, but not specifying exactly where they died or who they had been fighting against.

Several images, which have not been independently verified, emerged on social media this week after a video reporting the deaths of the boy and his father was uploaded to YouTube in September.

The original video - distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A'amaq - is understood to have since been removed, but a number of photographs of the boy have since been widely shared by ISIS militants and their sympathisers on social media.

One image shows the boy standing inside a house, grinning as he struggles to hold an assault rifle so large that it threatens to topple him over.

Last week a 24-year-old Muslim convert admitted taking her infant son to live among Islamic State terrorists in the Syrian city of Raqqa because she believes he will lead a 'better life' under their brutal regime.

Asiya Ummi Abdullah denied that children are unhappy living under the oppressive rule of ISIS' religious fanatics and explained that she felt her three-year-old son's spiritual well-being was better served in the group's de facto capital, where public crucifixions and beheadings are commonplace.

Ummi Abduallah - who had lived in Turkey since her teens but was born in Kyrgyzstan - said moving to the militant stronghold in Syria was in part to shield the young boy from the sex, crime, drugs and alcohol she sees as rampant in her home town Istanbul.

'Who says children here are unhappy?... He will know God and live under his rules,' she said.

Dramatic footage has emerged from inside Kobane showing brave Kurdish fighters battling against militants from the Islamic State.

The clip, which appears to have been filmed on a mobile phone, shows resistance forces from the Kurdish People's Protection Unit (YPG) firing assault rifles and machine guns mounted on the back of a car at militants hiding behind buildings in the Kobane suburbs.

The terrorists launched a renewed assault on Kobane last night, killing dozens of Kurds who have resisted ISIS' advances into the city's suburbs over the last three weeks.

Prepared: A Kurdish fighter takes up his position to fight the Islamic State jihadists

Islamic State militants are now in control of one third of the besieged Syrian city of Kobane despite three days of American airstrikes, a group monitoring violence in the country said today.

This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes.

While the airstrikes appear to have slowed the militants advance in some areas of the city, ISIS fighters appear to be creeping ever closer to the centre of Kobane, where thousands of civilians unable or unwilling to flee their homes face rape and massacre.

News of ISIS' gains came as the Pentagon admitted airstrikes alone will not be enough to prevent the fall of Kobane, raising serious questions over the U.S.'s wider campaign against the terror group.

Still flying: This morning the chilling sight of the group's black flag could clearly be seen above buildings inside the city; a brazen display of defiance in the face of sustained airstrikes by U.S. and Arab warplanes

Dramatic: The escalation in Kobane has seen the U.S. and Arab coalition carry out the most sustained period of bombing raids since their campaign to destroy the Islamic State in northern Syria started two weeks ago

Rear Admiral John Kirby, the Pentagon press secretary, said airstrikes are 'not going to be enough to save that city', amid growing concern that without Western ground troops being sent into Syria, the defeat of ISIS will prove a near impossible task.

Heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders said Islamic State militants had pushed into two districts of Kobane - a mainly Kurdish border city with 40,000 residents - by late last night.

Washington said the U.S. military and Arab partner nations responded to ISIS renewed assault by carrying out eight air strikes last night, adding that for now the city remains under Kurdish control.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights this morning said that despite overnight airstrikes, which have continued into this morning, Islamic State fighters managed to capture a police station in the east of Kobane and now control one third of the city."

However, an analysts citing supply chain sources claims to have narrowed down a significant proportion of the specifications.

According to Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company (via AppleInsider), Apple's smartwatch will feature 512MB of RAM, likely supplied by Samsung, Hynix and Micron. The Apple Watch is also being tipped to come in 4GB and 8GB variants, with the 4GB model the standard version. Arcuri says the flash-based storage will be procured from ""most major NAND suppliers.""

Arcuri also predicted that Broadcom BCM43342 chipset might act as the wireless combination chip for the Apple Watch. Interestingly, the chipset includes a GPS radio functionality, which is ""somewhat at odds"" with Apple's announcement of the Watch requiring to be paired with the iPhone for GPS data. The report speculates that either Apple has used a modified version of the chipset, or disabled GPS functionality for better battery life.

Scheduled to arrive in early 2015, the Apple Watch's wireless charging circuit seems to be supplied by Integrated Device Technology, while the NFC chips, power management integrated circuits, MEMS sensor, microcontroller, and Wi-Fi front-end chips are said to be supplied by NXP and AMS, Maxim Integrated Products and Dialog Semiconductor, Invensense, STMicroelectronics, and Skyworks respectively.

The Apple Watch was launched alongside the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus handsets at the firm's keynote event earlier this month. There are three variants of the Apple Watch - Watch Sport, Watch Edition and the Watch.

Across the three variants, there are a total of 18 different styles of straps available, which means that users will be able to customise the Apple Watch - both physically and in terms of software, to stand out from others, but Apple hasn't given out details on the pricing of different designs yet."
"130","Social media around the world have been flooded with rumors of Fidel Castro's death, but there was no sign Friday that the reports were true, even if the 88-year-old former Cuban leader has not been seen in public for months.

Similar speculation has swept across Cuban expatriate communities repeatedly over the decades, particularly after a serious illness forced him to step down from duties as president in 2006, handing over leadership to his younger brother Raul.

The new wave was prompted in part by Fidel Castro's failure to comment after the U.S. and Cuba declared on Dec. 17 that they would move to restore full diplomatic relations broken a half century ago.

The chatter appeared to pick up when some media noted Thursday that Castro had not been seen in public in a year. He last appeared on Jan. 8, 2014, at an art exhibition in Havana, ending nine months out of public view.

The most recent official photographs of Castro came out of a private meeting with Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on Aug. 21. He was also photographed with the Chinese and Russian presidents in July. Castro was last heard from on Oct. 18, when he published an editorial about Ebola.

By Friday, Cuba-related Twitter accounts were ablaze with speculation, fueled in large part by reports on news websites such as Diario de Cuba and Diario las Americas that Cuba had scheduled a news conference, possibly to discuss Castro's health.

The rumors were further stoked when respected Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera reported on its website that Castro had died. It quickly pulled the report back, however.

Cuban officials told news media in Havana that no press conference had been called, and there were no obvious signs of official preparations for mourning."

RadarOnline.com has learned that New York City’s dirtiest rats have rolled out the red carpet to welcome Anna Wintour and Vogue staffers to their swanky new offices at the Freedom Tower. According to insiders, the pesky rodents have invaded the infamous accessories closet and made their presence known by leaving droppings on desks, computers, and pricey couture!

“The office is over-run and the Vogue staff is secretly whispering that the rats could be cosmic payback for Anna’s decision to put Kim Kardashian and Kanye West on the cover,” a Vogue staffer revealed. “There was so much backlash, and now this!”

Condé Nast and Vogue recently decamped from Times Square to the new digs at One World Trade Center, and the move has not gone off without a hitch.

Vogue occupies floors 25 and 26, and “this is where the rats have taken up residence,” a source said. “Condé Nast has floors 20 through 44, but the rats are confined to the Vogue floors only. Hey, New York City rats are smart: they know where the good stuff is!”

“The famed accessories closet, which was being put together with the designer wares from the old office, was taking shape when the rats got into it,” the source revealed. “There were droppings all over the floor, and some of the shoe boxes had been chewed into.”

“The rats appear to have gotten in via the venting, which was being worked on even as staffers were moving in,” the source explained. “Walls were being moved to accommodate last-minute design changes by Anna and Condé Nast, and it’s assumed this is how the rats got in.”

Now, the source said, “A strict no food or drinks policy at people’s work stations has been issued until the infestation is gone.” (The source said pin-thin Wintour does, in fact, normally allow staffers to eat in the office.)

But meanwhile, “It’s very unnerving to come to work in the morning, and find rat droppings on computers, and desks!” the source said. “Anna isn’t amused and top pest control experts have been hired to get the problem dealt with quickly.”

Gawker, which broke the story, says Wintour has told assistants that her pristine office must be rat-free before she enters.

"146","US drones are being flown over Isil's Syrian ""capital"" for the first time as part of a drive by America to target Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the jihadist group's elusive leader.

Residents of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa have captured photo and video footage of remotely-piloted planes, which Western weapons experts have identified as American Predators, the same drones used in Pakistan and Yemen to attack suspected terrorists.

The US has not publicly stated that it is flying drones over Syria, and the sightings over Raqqa are the first indication that it is doing so.

The sightings are the clearest indication that President Barack Obama has dramatically changed his policy, aggressively stepping up reconnaissance of Isil positions as the US works to assemble an international coalition to fight the jihadists.

That diplomatic effort was given a major boost on Monday when Iraq's parliament finally voted to approve a new government aimed at winning broad support against Isil, with Haider al-Abadi as prime minister.

Mr Abadi, a member of Iraq's Shia majority, whose candidacy was supported by the US and other western powers, had promised to include members of the Sunni minority as well as Kurds within his government. The attempt to heal sectarian rifts is seen as vital to undermining Isil's appeal in the Sunni heartlands, where disaffection with the previous Shia-dominated government assisted the extremist Islamist group in its rise.

Mr Obama immediately called Haider al-Abadi, the new prime minister, and urged him to move quickly to address ""the legitimate grievances"" of Iraq's disenchanted Sunnis.

John Kerry, the US secretary of state, said the formation of the unity government was ""a major milestone"" for Iraq.

MPs in Baghdad also voted to approve three senior figures in the largely ceremonial role of deputy presidents: Nouri al-Maliki, ousted as prime minister in July, Osama al-Nujeifi, a Sunni and former parliament speaker, and Iyad Allawi, a secular Shia politician who refused to join the last government.

But the all-important posts of interior and defence ministers would be filled over the next week, Mr Abadi told MPs.

In the battle against Isil, the Pentagon told the Telegraph on Monday that it had ""not yet conducted any strikes against targeted individuals"", but refused to rule out the possibility that it was using drones for surveillance.

The US is trying to pinpoint the location of Baghdadi, the jihadist who has declared himself the caliph of captured territory in Iraq and Syria that is the size of Britain, and ruler of its eight million inhabitants.

Several residents of Raqqa and jihadists from Isil have captured pictures of a white drone circling overhead, reporting that it flew low over the city for most of Friday and again on Saturday.

Abu Ibrahim al-Raqqawi, an anti-Isil activist in Raqqa who posted pictures of the drone, told The Telegraph he had first seen it on Friday. ""It flew over the city for about three hours, from noon until 3pm,"" said Mr Raqqawi, who uses a pseudonym to protect his identity.

Mr Raqqawi also reported seeing it on Saturday at the same time that other residents posted news of the sightings online.

Experts said they believed the aircraft was an unarmed MQ-1 Predator on a reconnaissance flight. Aaron Stein, an associate fellow with the Royal United Services Institute think tank, said it could be identified by its ""distinct downward facing V-shaped tail"".

Mr Stein said that the photographs indicated the drone was unarmed. ""The evidence thus far suggests that the drone is acquiring imagery - and possibly signals intelligence - of Islamic State positions in the group's most important stronghold.""

Killing Baghdadi would be a major coup for the US president, who has been widely criticised for not taking tough enough action against Isil.

Its impact on the jihadist group is less certain, however: Baghdadi sits at the apex of an elaborate hierarchy, with a ""cabinet"" of deputies who manage the group's military operations and domestic governance.

In the event of his death, power would probably transfer to his deputy, Fadel Ahmad Abdullah al-Hiyali, a former commander in Saddam Hussein's military who is in charge of Isil's Iraqi territory.

In July Baghdadi made a surprise appearance in Mosul, Iraq's second city, where he led men in prayers at the city's Great Mosque, but he rarely shows himself publicly and little is known about his whereabouts since then.

Raqqa, a key city in Isil's embryonic ""state"", would need to be scrutinised closely in any hunt for Baghdadi.

Mr Obama would be required personally to order a strike against the Isil leader, weighing the advantages of his death against the risk of civilian casualties, but Aki Peritz, a former CIA counter-terrorism analyst, predicted he would do so if the opportunity arose.

""The US is already exerting lethal force against the Islamic State. If it had the opportunity to take its top dog off the battlefield once and for all, the US would pull the trigger,"" Mr Peritz said.

The US president is due to give a speech on Wednesday preparing the American public for a campaign against Isil tha officials believe could extend beyond Mr Obama's remaining two years in office.

In an interview with NBC, Mr Obama said the US would fight Isil in a manner ""similar to the kinds of counter-terrorism campaigns that we've been engaging in consistently over the last five, six, seven years.""

He has put drone strikes at the heart of America's global struggle against jihadist groups. Last week the US announced it had killed the leader of Somalia's al-Shabaab terror group."
"147","Tiger Woods is not serving a suspension from the PGA Tour for failing a drug test, his agent and a Tour official emphatically stated Monday.

“These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,” Mark Steinberg said in a statement (via ESPN). “They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.”

The allegations were made by golf pro Dan Olsen on 730 The Game radio in East Lansing, Mich., Friday. “I’ve heard that he’s suspended,” Olsen said on “Mad Dog in the Morning.” “I heard he’s on a month’s suspension. And it’s not, it’s kind of a strong witness. It’s a credible person that’s telling me this. Well, it’s not testosterone, but it’s something else.”

Woods, who has struggled mentally and physically with his game, announced Feb. 11 that he was taking an indefinite leave from golf, saying his game “needs a lot of work.” Among his many injuries over the last few years, he underwent a microdiscectomy last spring. He was withdrawn from play three times because of an injury and no longer ranks among the world’s top 70 players.

On Monday, Olsen, a 48-year-old who last played on the Tour in 2011, was walking back his allegations.

“Everything I said on that radio interview was only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts,” Olsen told ESPN. “I want to make a full retraction to everything I said for the entire radio interview. And I apologize to Tiger, Nike, Phil [Mickelson], [Commissioner] Tim Finchem and the PGA Tour.”

Olsen had questioned the Nike ball with which Woods plays, too, saying, “I would almost bet hadn’t been tested. … So he’s really playing with — I’m not gonna say a cheater ball, because he has the help of the establishment, really — but he played a ball that nobody else could play. … So that combined with his enhancement issues, like having a Canadian blood spinning doctor in his phone, you know? I mean, I think people are starting to openly call it what it is, which is gonna be a problem for him.”

Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour, shot down the report Monday, too, and the Tour, according to ESPN, says it is required to announce a suspension.

“There is no truth whatsoever to these claims,” he told USA Today. “We categorically deny these allegations.”"

"149","What's thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. 
The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:

class=""cnn_storypgraphtxt cnn_storypgraph3"">In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.""
Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson."

Stan Beaton, from Mirfield, had kept the voicemail since his wife Ruby's death in 2003, but technical work by Virgin Media meant it was deleted.

However, the telecoms company has now managed to recover the message.

Mr Beaton, 68, said: ""They've made this old age pensioner extremely happy.""

Listening to the message he said: ""It's just a wonderful, wonderful sound that I thought was lost forever.

""I'm staggered at the lengths they have gone to.""

Mr Beaton told BBC Radio Leeds the message he had kept since his wife's death from cancer was lost in December.

He said: ""I've always resisted changing companies because whenever I mentioned that my wife's voice was our voicemail message and would it be retained and each company said no, so that's why I never changed.

""Sadly it disappeared. I was absolutely devastated by it, but also extremely angry.

""In the early days [I listened to it] quite often. Basically it came to the point when if I felt low then I would listen to it.

""In December I learned that it had disappeared. I just could not tell people how it affected me at that time. It really did devastate me.""

Mr Beaton contacted Virgin who managed to retrieve the message which has now been permanently saved for him.

Rob Evans, executive director of engineering at Virgin Media, said finding it ""was like searching for a needle in a haystack"", however a team of 11 engineers spent three days tracking it down.

""The chances of its recovery were slim"" he said, but the missing file containing Ruby's voice was found on Friday.

""The next morning we called Stan to deliver the good news,"" he said."
"152","In the Omsk region of Russia, a teen boy developed ""superpowers"" after he suffered electric shock. The boy, Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, discovered that he could attract metal items. He currently considers an idea of becoming a superhero.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things. Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me,"" the boy, a second-grader, told Omsk TV and Radio Company.

Electric shock changed the boy's life. He has now become the most popular boy at school. Classmates often ask him to demonstrate his superpowers. Moreover, Nikolai can ""share"" his power. According to his peers, he can influence others so that people turn into live magnets as well. 

""I could even hang a ladle on my nose,"" Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina said.

Journalists compared Nikolai to Marvel Comics character Magneto, who had similar abilities. The boy also says that he wants to become a superhero, although his teachers say that Nikolai is a very kind and friendly boy. 

Stories about ""living magnets"" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century. In 2004, the story of Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received an extensive media coverage - the people obtained the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

Although the people, who have the ability to attract metal items, are commonly referred to as ""magnets,"" many of them can also hold plastic, glass, wood and paper items on their body. Only some of them develop a ""preference"" for a particular material. In 1990, as many as 300 ""living magnets"" gathered for a conference in Sofia, Bulgaria, after young woman Marinela Brankova demonstrated her amazing ability on TV. The woman could hold 7 kilos of metal on a vertical palm.

Researchers of the anomalous say that environment around us is filled with various vibrations - mechanical movements, electromagnetic vibrations, molecular vibrations, etc. We all live in an ocean of electromagnetic waves. Some people may act as magnet coils, accumulating and intensifying energy, making various items stick to their body. Some researchers believe that such anomalous phenomena are more common in the areas where ecological situation is poor. People may mutate under the influence of environment and develop such unusual capabilities. Some may develop stronger mutations and even levitate. Levitation is also a manifestation of mutations. For example, in medieval legends, witches and wizards would be of abnormally low weight, and could even hover above the ground."

The bogus report read: ""Nasa has confirmed that the Earth will experience 6 days of almost complete darkness and will happen from the dates Tuesday the 16 – Monday the 22 in December.

"155","Comcast allegedly pulled strings to get one of their customers fired from his job at a prestigious accounting firm after he complained about billing issues and false charges. The former Comcast customer, identified only as ""Conal,"" told his story to Consumerist, the site whose readers have named Comcast ""the worst company in America"" two years running.

Conal says his trouble started with a few erratic charges: Bills sometimes didn't show up, and he was charged for equipment that was never activated, or that he didn't actually have. Customer service reps promised the problems would be resolved. Instead, things got significantly more hellish in October of last year.

According to Conal, Comcast sent him nearly $2,000 of equipment he'd never ordered and didn't want, and tried to bill him for it anyway.

But, as an accountant by trade, he had no problem documenting every billing error and overcharge, and he brought them in as a spreadsheet when he dropped off the unwanted DVRs, modems, and other equipment.

Even then, Conal says, he wasn't able to get his money back. Instead, Comcast sent him to collections in February.

And this is where Conal made the call that allegedly cost him his job. Per Consumerist:

On Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast's customer service, which hadn't been of any help in the year he'd been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company's Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.

He describes that callback as ""bizarre,"" with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with ""How can I help you?"" Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn't specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.

So he tried the Controller's office again, to let them know that the rep they'd sent his way had failed miserably at her job.

Considering that even Comcast acknowledges its customer service experience is so broken that it could take years to reform, you can hardly blame a customer who understands corporate structures for escalating his complaint.

Comcast did blame Conal, though. Consumerist again:

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal's subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he'd only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

The creepiest part is that, although he was allegedly fired for throwing around the name of his powerful employer—who, surprise, happens to do business with Comcast—Conal swears he never told anyone at Comcast where he worked. He believes they just went the extra mile to look him up online and contact his company—because Comcast cares.

Comcast has confirmed at least one part of the story: In a letter to Conal's lawyer, who is considering filing suit against the cable provider, Comcast's lawyer said the company did contact Conal's job.

Comcast's counsel says the ex-customer ""is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn"" about his customer service struggle.

It seems that arguing with you on the phone for 20 minutes or trying to talk you into paying fees you know are fradulent is nowhere near the worst thing Comcast can inflict on you, the customer.

They can apparently also wreck your life in ways that have nothing to do with your cable or internet services.

Really looking forward to Comcast becoming basically the only cable provider in America!

"156","It is the most expensive - and many would argue delicious - part of a sushi menu.

But one man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm.

To his horror, scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish.

One man's love of sashimi nearly killed him after it led to his body becoming riddled with tapeworm

The Chinese man had seen his doctor complaining of stomach ache and itchy skin. Scans revealed his entire body had been infected with tapeworm parasites after eating too much sashimi - raw slices of fish

Humans contract tapeworm infections from sushi by eating raw fish that has been infected with the worm in its larvae stage.

When fish eat tapeworm eggs, the hatching larvae attach themselves to the intestinal wall of the fish and the worms infect the fish flesh.

Because sushi is not cooked, the larvae can in turn transfer into the flesh of any human that eats the fish.

Once a human is infected, a tapeworm will grow inside the intestine to a length of up to 15metres over a period of weeks. It can survive for years and go undetected for weeks or months, in turn releasing its own eggs that infect other parts of the human body.

Symptoms include fatigue, constipation and abdominal discomfort - which can be so mild the victim may not notice anything is wrong.

If larvae begin to migrate to other parts of the body they can start to eat away at the liver, eyes, heart or brain and cause life-threatening conditions.

Doctors believe some of the uncooked Japanese delicacy of raw meat or fish must have become contaminated.

He was treated at the Guangzhou No. 8 People's Hospital in Guangdong Province, in eastern China.

Research has shown that eating raw or undercooked fish can lead to a variety of parasitic infections.

Tapeworm infections occur after ingesting the larvae of diphyllobothrium, found in freshwater fish such as salmon, although marinated and smoked fish can also transmit the worm.

While cases have increased in poorer areas due to improved sanitation, cases have increased in more developed countries,.

This is most likely due to the soaring popularity of sushi, say doctors writing in the journal Canadian Family Physician.

Study author Nancy Craig wrote: 'The widespread popularity of Japanese sushi and sashimi (slices of raw fish) is a contributor.

'But other popular dishes might also be implicated, such as raw salted or marinated fillets - which originate from Baltic and Scandinavian countries - carpaccio - very thin slices of raw fish common in Italy, raw salmon and ceviche - lightly marinated fish.'

Dr Yin, of Guangzhou No. 8 People’s Hospital, told the website that'smags.com that eating uncooked food contaminated with tapeworms' eggs could eventually cause cysticercosis, when the adult worms enters a person’s blood stream.

This type of infection is life-threatening once it reaches the brain.

"158","Hundreds of Palestinians were evacuated from their homes Sunday morning after Israeli authorities opened a number of dams near the border, flooding the Gaza Valley in the wake of a recent severe winter storm.

The Gaza Ministry of Interior said in a statement that civil defense services and teams from the Ministry of Public Works had evacuated more than 80 families from both sides of the Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) after their homes flooded as water levels reached more than three meters.

Gaza has experienced flooding in recent days amid a major storm that saw temperatures drop and frigid rain pour down.

The storm displaced dozens and caused hardship for tens of thousands, including many of the approximately 110,000 Palestinians left homeless by Israel's assault over summer.

The suffering is compounded by the fact that Israel has maintained a complete siege over Gaza for the last eight years, severely limiting electricity and the availability of fuel for generators. It has also prevented the displaced from rebuilding their homes, as construction materials are largely banned from entering.

Gaza civil defense services spokesman Muhammad al-Midana warned that further harm could be caused if Israel opens up more dams in the area, noting that water is currently flowing at a high speed from the Israel border through the valley and into the Mediterranean sea.

Evacuated families have been sent to shelters sponsored by UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, in al-Bureij refugee camp and in al-Zahra neighborhood in the central Gaza Strip.

The Gaza Valley (Wadi Gaza) is a wetland located in the central Gaza Strip between al-Nuseirat refugee camp and al-Moghraqa. It is called HaBesor in Hebrew, and it flows from two streams -- one whose source runs from near Beersheba, and the other from near Hebron.

Israeli dams on the river to collect rainwater have dried up the wetlands inside Gaza, and destroyed the only source of surface water in the area.

Locals have continued to use it to dispose of their waste for lack of other ways to do so, however, creating an environmental hazard.

This is not the first time Israeli authorities have opened the Gaza Valley dams.

In Dec. 2013, Israeli authorities also opened the dams amid heavy flooding in the Gaza Strip. The resulting floods damaged dozens of homes and forces many families in the area from their homes.

In 2010, the dams were opened as well, forcing 100 families from their homes. At the time civil defense services said that they had managed to save seven people who had been at risk of drowning."

Canada is assembling a camp in Kuwait to launch its own air campaign over Iraq, sending six CF-18 fighters, two surveillance craft and a refuelling aircraft to help the U.S.-led coalition’s air strikes against Islamic State.

JETS: FIRST SIGN OF ISLAMISTS USING WARPLANES

Islamic State has been flying the planes over the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo, said Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

Reuters was not immediately able to verify the report and U.S. Central Command said it was not aware of Islamic State flying jets in Syria.

“They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,” Abdulrahman said. “People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,” he said, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 70 kilometressouth of the Turkish border.

Witnesses reported the flights were at a low altitude and only lasted five to 10 minutes before landing, the observatory said. It was not possible to reach the Syrian government for comment and state media did not mention the report.

It was not clear whether the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances in the planes, which witnesses said appeared to be MiG 21 or MiG 23 models captured from the Syrian military.

General Lloyd Austin, head of the U.S. military’s Central Command, said he could not confirm that Iraqi pilots had joined Islamic State. “We don’t have any operational reporting of ISIL flying jets in support of ISIL activity on the ground and so I cannot confirm that. And to the degree that pilots may have defected and joined the ranks of ISIL, I don’t have any information on that either,” he told a Pentagon news briefing, referring to Islamic State by an acronym.

LONDON: POLICE ALLEGE ISLAMIST PLOT TO KILL POLICE

Four men appeared in a British court on Friday, charged under anti-terrorism legislation with swearing allegiance to Islamic State militants and preparing to launch an attack on policemen or soldiers on the streets of London.

The four, who were arrested over the past two weeks, are variously charged with obtaining a handgun and conducting “hostile reconnaissance” of Shepherd’s Bush police station in west London and the nearby White City reservist army barracks. Further charges include storing images sent via photo-sharing service Instagram of two police officers and of two civilian police community support officers.

“This is a plot, in essence, to shoot, to kill, police officers or soldiers on the streets of London,” prosecutor Mark Dawson told Westminster Magistrates’ Court.

Tarik Hassane, 21; Suhaib Majeed, 20; Nyall Hamlett, 24; and Momen Motasim, 21, all from the London area, were remanded in custody after a brief hearing to appear at the Old Bailey court on Oct. 27. They have yet to enter a plea. A fifth man, Nathan Cuffy, 25, also from London, was remanded in custody on firearms offences.

BRITAIN: A 14TH-CENTURY TREASON LAW REVISITED

Britain may use a medieval law dating to 1351 to charge citizens with treason if they go to fight with Islamic State insurgents in Iraq and Syria, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said.

Security officials say some 500 Britons – largely with Muslim immigrant backgrounds – are believed to be fighting in Iraq and Syria, though the true figure could be much greater and security officials worry that those who return could carry out an attack on Britain.

Hammond said any British citizen who had sworn personal allegiance to Islamic State could have committed an offense under the Treason Act of 1351, passed during the reign of England’s King Edward III. The maximum sentence for treason in Britain is life imprisonment. It was death until 1998.

The last person to be hanged for treason in Britain was William Joyce, a propagandist for Nazi Germany nicknamed Lord Haw Haw who broadcast to Britain during the Second World War and who was executed in 1946.

"167","LAS VEGAS -- The person behind the $300,000 dinner at Bellagio’s Prime Steakhouse has been revealed.

Bloomberg News reported Wednesday that Vice Media Inc. CEO Shane Smith sprung for the dinner following a lucky run at the casino’s blackjack tables. Bloomberg said its source was a person who asked not to be identified because the meal was private.

On Tuesday, MGM Resorts International Chairman Jim Murren cited the dinner bill as an “encouraging sign” that Las Vegas visitors were eager to spend money again. He said the dinner was for a party of more than a dozen people at the upscale Prime and included wine with a price tag upward of $15,000 per bottle.

A guest at the dinner, who asked not to be identified, told Bloomberg the dinner party was closer to 25.

Murren said he hadn’t seen a check like that since 2007.

Bloomberg termed Brooklyn-based Vice a media titan that “has grown from a free, whiskey-stained Montreal monthly.” Technology Crossover Ventures and A+E Networks each invested $250 million for 10 percent stakes in the company last year.

Smith is 45 and, according to Gawker, gave $1 million to Vice’s staff at last year’s holiday party.

Let’s start with a little backgrounder in gold. Everyone has a vague sense that gold is expensive. Even rabid Internet trolls have seen the banner ads and heard about that in the news. But most people don’t understand just how expensive even a little bit of gold is. So this is a good place to begin the discussion.

Update: My calculations were wrong! Also, this was a bit “back of the envelope.” Now that it has some readership I realize I should go back and fix the calculations in the article to be more realistic…

Here are the basic facts:

Gold currently sells for between $1,200 and $1,300 per troy ounce and has been over $1,000 per troy ounce for the last five years.
18-karat gold contains 75% pure gold, and that term is regulated by law.
One ounce of 18k gold occupies about 1.8 cubic centimeters of volume since a typical 18-karat gold alloy weighs about 16.5 grams per cc.
18-karat gold currently sells for $29.11 per gram, $905 per troy ounce, or $480 per cc.
.25 cc of 18k gold is about enough to construct a watch buckle and .75 cc gets you a deployant clasp. It takes a few more to build a watch case, anywhere from 1.5 to 8 cc depending on the size and thickness of the case. So the buckle is worth $120-$360 and the watch case $720 to $3800 just as raw gold. This is why gold watches generally sell for a lot more than $6,000!

Gold Watches are Expensive

Let’s apply this to a watch case. Imagine you wanted to create a rectangular case 42 mm high by 36 mm wide by 10 mm deep. If it was solid, this would equal 15.12 cc of volume. But it’s a watch case, so you have to leave room for the movement, dial, case back, etc. So let’s just leave 5 mm of thickness all around, making a hollow rectangle. This equals 6.8 cc (42 x 36 x 10 – 32 x 26 x 10). Therefore, the raw gold to make just the case of this hypothetical watch would cost $3,200 as of this writing.

A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost over $8,300
A simple 42x36x10 mm rectangle of 5 mm thick 18-karat gold would cost more than $3,200
Now let’s consider the same shape but just 2 mm thick. That’s 2.9 cc of gold, worth $1,400. Pick your thickness and you’re still looking at thousands of dollars worth of gold.

How does this translate in the real world? Let’s look at the retail price of some watches that are available in both stainless steel and 18-karat gold.

This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
This Cartier Tank MC is $15,000 more in 18k gold
The Cartier Tank MC measures 44 mm by 34 mm by 9.5 mm thick: $15,000 extra (list) for 18k gold
Cartier Tank MC in stainless steel: $7,000 list, $5,800 street
Cartier Tank MC in 18k pink gold: $22,000 list, $18,200 street
The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime measures 50.5 mm by 34.9 mm by 14 mm thick: $14,750 extra (list) for 18k gold
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in stainless steel: $8,550 list, $6,800 street
Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime in 18k pink gold: $23,300 list, $18,400 street
This list could go on and on, but the gist is simple: 18-karat gold cases cost a lot more than stainless steel. In fact, it’s pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size and from any manufacturer. Even tiny quartz ladies watches like the tiny Chopard Happy Sport Mini sells for $11,000! Most of the bargains commenters have pointed to are either 14-karat or less, very slim and small, or long out of production and with outdated pricing.

Then there’s the bracelet. Swap a gold bracelet for a leather strap and you are looking at an extra $20,000. Adding a gold bracelet to that Jaeger-LeCoultre bumps the price to $42,900!

Certainly there is quite a bit of profit in luxury watches, but one simply cannot deny the raw material value in a gold watch case. And the gold market is liquid like stocks and other commodities: There are plenty of buyers and sellers of gold, and plenty of reserves, so no company, no matter how strong, can expect favorable pricing from their suppliers.

Another reason companies charge so much for gold watches and jewelry is as a hedge against volatility. They can’t price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labor, distribution, and profit in a watch.

The Apple Watch Edition Will Cost $10,000

There’s a reason I picked those two watches for my comparisons: Both are similar in size and shape to the 42 mm Apple Watch. The Cartier is a little smaller and the Jaeger-LeCoultre is a little larger, but both represent a traditional watchmaker’s gold-cased square-ish offering in the space. And both cost more than $20,000, with much of that price going to the gold case and matching buckle. And Jony Ive recently said that the historic Cartier Tank was one of his inspirations for the Apple Watch design!

Apple would be crazy to sell the Apple Watch Edition for $20,000, though. That’s not going to happen. So they’re likely to find ways to reduce the cost dramatically.

First, as we can see, the Apple Watch case is highly rounded in all three dimensions. Although questionable from an esthetic standpoint, this reduces the amount of material required by quite a lot. Second, Apple Watch has a large sapphire crystal front and back with the display, sensors, and such. Third, the interior frame is likely made of steel or aluminum, not gold, to reduce cost and increase commonality with the aluminum and steel versions.

Could it be gold plated? No. Numerous reports state that it is a solid gold case. Although Apple has not apparently used the word, “solid” in their press releases, they do claim it is “crafted from 18-karat gold” and nowhere does it say it is plated or “gold filled” (the industry term). There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could.

Apple says that the Apple Watch will start at $349 for that aluminum Sport model, and many bloggers have reported the price for the steel Apple Watch to be roughly $1,000. It is reasonable to assume that the gold Edition model will sell for substantially more than this, with many suggesting $4,000 or $5,000. But remember that this price would only cover 4 or 5 ounces of gold! Even with thin walls and a steel frame, it’s hard to see how Apple could make a solid 18-karat gold case and buckle for a 42 mm watch with just 3 ounces of gold.

Gold is soft, but Apple claims that their special gold is twice as hard as “standard gold”. Taking that at face value, perhaps they reduced the thickness of the case commensurately, cutting the amount of gold in half versus a standard rectangular watch. This still leaves a few thousand dollars of material value in the case. The Apple Watch Edition will come in 38 mm and 42 mm sizes, a difference of about 20% in terms of case volume. So the smaller model could sell for 20% less still.

My prediction is that the 42 mm Apple Watch Edition will retail for $9,999 with the 38 mm Apple Watch Edition retailing for $7,999. This covers the cost of the gold case, the internals, manufacturing, sales, and profit, and yet does not leave Apple subsidizing the world gold market by selling at a discount or cheating with a too-thin or plated case. I will be shocked if the price is $4,999, but I suppose it’s possible with some finagling and if that’s the smaller model. And it will not be any less than that.

This is a $10,000 product
This is a $10,000 product
Bonus prediction: Given the very high price of the Apple Watch Edition, I predict that availability will be quite limited. Apple will likely create special store-within-a-store spaces in certain Apple Store locations for the Edition. I further expect them to open special standalone Apple Edition Boutiques to sell the Watch Edition, accessories, and perhaps other future high-end products.

Update!

Needless to say, many people disagree with me. And now that @Gruber Fireballed this post, I imagine I’ll hear from lots of them real soon!

The gist of the disagreement lies in the amount of gold needed for the watch case. I assumed it would be quite thick (read sturdy) and would contain upwards of 130 grams of 18k gold. Then there’s the strap lugs and buckle which would likely contain another few dozen grams. But @GAK_PDX  (and others, though he was most visually eloquent) suspects it contains much less gold.


I think this number is way too low, but it’s a good lower bound if the case was very thin and completely hollow. And it puts the raw gold at about $849 at $29.11 per gram of 18k gold. Although this is admittedly much, much lower than my estimate, it still illustrates my point that the Apple Watch Edition is not going to be cheap. And I think he’s way off but time will tell who is right and who is wrong.

Another argument is based on this 2006 analysis of a gold Rolex watch. Right off the bat one should point out that gold cost $400/oz when it was written and that watch includes a gold bracelet as well, something Apple is apparently not going to do with the Edition. That Rolex case contained 18.5 grams of gold alloy, but it’s much, much smaller than the Apple watch and it’s circular to boot! A 34mm circle is 107mm in circumference, while the 42mm Apple Watch is 156mm in circumference. Use the magic of math to scale the Rolex up into a 42mm rectangle and we’re at 27.75 grams. But that case is also much thinner since we excluded the bezel, and the Apple Watch is pretty slab-sided. So we can probably double this safely and come out with $1,615 of gold in my mangled square Rolex case.

So there are lower estimates than mine for the amount and value of the gold. I can accept that. But let’s take a step back and think about the final price. Even if it contained less than $1,500 of gold, how much would it sell for? Certainly not $2,000 or $3,000. You still have to account for the cost of everything else, plus the intangibles of manufacturing and distribution. And profit for Apple (and a hedge against the volatility of the price of gold). So we’re back at the $4,000-$5,000 estimate others have made. As Greg Koenig tweeted, and Forbes reported, “If anyone thinks Apple is charging less than $5k for the Edition, they are smoking crack.”

Regardless of the total, it’s important to realize that the price of gold is in the driver’s seat when it comes to pricing the Apple Watch Edition.

I’d love to be wrong, and I look forward to updating this piece. Thanks for reading!"

"170","Leading up to the somber anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, there are fresh fears of possible 9/11-style attacks taking place across North Africa as radical Islamist groups in Libya have reportedly seized nearly a dozen commercial airliners in the last month.

While counterterrorism officials are reportedly concerned that the missing jetliners could be used by terrorists to carry out deadly attacks, the timing of the theft is also setting off alarms. The concern is that radical Islamist groups will use the planes to mark the anniversary of the deadly 9/11 attacks, according to alleged intelligence reports disseminated within the U.S. government.

Reports that Islamist militias have seized the jetliners come just weeks before the 13th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.
“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. … We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,” one official reportedly told the Washington Free Beacon.

The aircraft were reportedly stolen in August after Islamists took control of the Tripoli International Airport. It was later reported that 11 commercial jetliners were missing.

On Sept. 11, 2012, four Americans were killed during a terrorist attack on a U.S. compound in Benghazi, Libya. At first, the Obama administration blamed the attack on a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim YouTube video.

When pressed by the Free Beacon, a “senior State Department counterterrorism official” refused to comment on reports of stolen jetliners in Libya. Another State Department told the online publication, “We can’t confirm that.”

It was also reported on Tuesday that Islamic State militants beheaded a second American journalist, Steven Sotloff. Just as they did when they murdered photojournalist James Foley, the terrorists reportedly uploaded a video showing the gruesome execution.

"171","WASHINGTON — A U.S. Republican senator and frequent Mideast traveler said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.

The Pentagon said Thursday that it is working with Qatar and is confident that any threat posed by the former detainees can be mitigated.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, who recently visited Qatar, said he had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country but said he was assured during his visit that all five remain in the small Gulf nation.

Qatar gained public praise from President Barack Obama for brokering the controversial deal in May 2014 that freed Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl from Taliban captivity in exchange for the release of the five senior Taliban officials who had been imprisoned for years at the U.S.-run Guantanamo Bay prison in Cuba.

Qatar promised Obama it would keep the five under watch for one year, although they would then be free to leave.

""It's just a year deal,"" Graham told The Associated Press on Wednesday. ""Just as sure as we're sitting here, they're going back to the fight.""

""They've had some Haqqani people come to meet with them. ... They're reaching out. The Taliban five are communicating with people inside Afghanistan.""

However, Graham, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and a leading Capitol Hill voice on foreign policy, said all five are still in Qatar.

""I was afraid one had left, but they told me they're all still there,"" he said.

The Pentagon said in a statement that it would not comment on specific cases involving the detainees.

""However, we take any incidence of re-engagement very seriously, and we work in close coordination through military, intelligence, law enforcement and diplomatic channels to mitigate re-engagement and to take follow-on action when necessary,"" the statement said. ""The Defense Department has a close security partnership with the government of Qatar. We're confident in our ability to continue to mitigate any threat that may be posed by the former Guantanamo detainees.""

Haqqani operates in the Afghanistan-Pakistan border region and has been one of the deadliest threats to U.S. troops in the war. The network, which the State Department designated as a foreign terrorist organization in 2012, claims allegiance to the Afghan Taliban but operates with some degree of autonomy.

The five detainees released were:

Abdul Haq Wasiq, who served as the Taliban deputy minister of intelligence.
Mullah Norullah Nori, a senior Taliban commander in the northern city of Mazar-e-Sharif when the Taliban fought U.S. forces in late 2001.
Khairullah Khairkhwa, who served in various Taliban positions including interior minister and had direct ties to Mullah Omar and Osama bin Laden.
Mohammed Nabi, who served as chief of security for the Taliban in Qalat, Afghanistan, and later worked as a radio operator for the Taliban's communications office in Kabul.
Mohammad Fazl, who Human Rights Watch says could be prosecuted for war crimes for presiding over the mass killing of Shiite Muslims in Afghanistan in 2000 and 2001 as the Taliban sought to consolidate their control over the country.

"173","Nicaraguan officials have appealed for witnesses to a meteorite strike that left a 12m-wide crater near Managua's international airport on Saturday night.

Residents reported a loud boom as the meteorite crashed but scientists said no one had come forward who had seen the streak that a speeding space rock would score across the sky.

""I was sitting on my porch and I saw nothing, then all of a sudden I heard a large blast,"" Jorge Santamaria told the Associated Press. ""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave.""

A government spokeswoman, Rosario Murillo, said a team formed to study the event believed the 5m-deep crater was left by a relatively small meteorite that appeared to have come off an asteroid passing close to Earth. She said international scientists had been called in to help with the investigation.

The meteorite may have been a fragment of a house-sized asteroid nicknamed Pitbull, which hurtled past Earth on Sunday night at a distance of 40,000km.

Dan Brown, an astronomer at Nottingham Trent University, said that although the Nicaraguan impact occurred 12 hours before Pitbull passed Earth, Central America was facing the right direction for the strike to be a fragment associated with the asteroid.

Pieces of the asteroid could have broken off during collisions with other rocks in the asteroid belt or through heating when the asteroid swung around the sun.

""It certainly makes absolute sense that people surrounding the impact site heard a loud boom. But a flash of light or bright object should also have been observed before that,"" Brown said.

Humberto Saballos, a volcanologist with the Nicaraguan Institute of Territorial Studies, told the AP it was unclear whether the meteorite disintegrated or was buried on impact at the site. The meteorite could have exploded in the air and produced a shockwave that made the crater, or struck the ground and left small fragments embedded in the soil.

Witness accounts of the meteorite strike would help scientists confirm when the meteorite struck and the path it took – information that could link it to Pitbull or rule out the asteroid as the source of the rock. Wilfried Strauch, an adviser to the Institute of Territorial Studies, said it was strange no one had reported a streak of light. ""We have to ask if anyone has a photo or something.""

If investigators can find remnants of the meteorite in the crater, then its chemical makeup could be compared with measurements of the larger asteroid taken from ground-based telescopes.

""It's a wake-up call that we need to understand more about the flight paths of asteroids,"" Brown said."

According to British astronomer Patrick Moore, at exactly 9:47 PST AM on January 4th, Pluto will pass directly behind Jupiter, in relation to Earth. This rare alignment will mean that the combined gravitational force of the two planets would exert a stronger tidal pull, temporarily counteracting the Earth’s own gravity and making people virtually weightless. Moore calls this the Jovian-Plutonian Gravitational Effect.

Moore told scientists that they could experience the phenomenon by jumping in the air at the precise moment the alignment occurred. If they do so, he promised, they would experience a strange floating sensation.

"181","While Apple announced that the base model of its forthcoming smartwatch would cost $350, it's remained tight-lipped about the pricing of the rest of the range. Now, a new report suggests that the stainless steel version will start at $500, and the gold at somewhere between $4,000 and $5,000.

The report comes from sources at Apple via French website iGen.fr. As MacRumors points out, the site has been reliable in the past, accurately reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

The cost of the gold model, though; well, quite simply it depends on how much gold there is. We'll have to wait to find out, but such high pricing would indeed make it very much a luxury item.

"185","A photo provided by the Nicaraguan Army shows an impact crater made by a small meteorite in a wooded area near Managua's international airport. Photo: AP

Managua: A mysterious explosion that rocked Nicaragua's crowded capital Managua, creating a large crater, appears to have been caused by a small meteorite.

Amazingly, in a sprawling city of 1.2 million people, the impact near the international airport did not cause any known injuries, but it did leave a crater measuring 12 metres across and was felt throughout the capital late on Saturday night, local time.

Nicaraguan authorities believe it was a piece of the small asteroid dubbed ""2014 RC"", which passed very close to Earth on Sunday and was estimated by astronomers to be about 20 metres wide, or the size of a house.

""We are convinced that this was a meteorite. We have seen the crater from the impact,"" said Wilfredo Strauss of the Seismic Institute.

The meteorite appeared to have hurtled into a wooded area near the airport around midnight and the hit was so large that it registered on the instruments Dr Strauss's organisation uses to measure earthquakes.

""You can see two waves: first, a small seismic wave when the meteorite hit earth, and then another stronger one, which is the impact of the sound,"" he said.

Government officials and experts visited the impact site on Sunday.

One of them, William Martinez, said it was not yet clear if the meteorite burned up completely or if it had been blasted into the soil.

""You can see mirror-like spots on the sides of the crater from where the meteorite power-scraped the walls,"" Dr Martinez said.

People who live near the crater told local media they heard a blast they took for an explosion, and that liquid, sand and dust were blown through the air, which smelled like something had burned.

Nicaragua has more than 20 volcanoes and is regularly shaken by earthquakes, so many locals initially thought a quake caused the loud bang.

There were no reported injuries because the impact was in a wooded spot, and flights at the airport were not affected.

NASA said last week that the asteroid 2014 RC, at the time of closest approach, would be about one-tenth the distance from the centre of Earth to the moon, or about 40,000 kilometres.

It had been projected to be roughly over New Zealand at the time of its closest approach, which astronomers had calculated would be on Sunday about 1818 GMT (4.18am on Monday AEST).

"186","The sound of 10 or 11 shots from the gun of Ferguson, Mo. police officer Darren Wilson being fired at Michael Brown were recorded by a man in an apartment near the Aug. 9 shooting, according to the man’s attorney who shared the audio with CNN.

The network aired the recording Monday but has not verified its authenticity.

The 12-second audio begins with a man seemingly leaving a message for someone on an adult video service.

Six shots fired in rapid succession are heard in the background. After a two second pause, another four or five shots ring out.

Lopa Blumenthal, the unnamed man’s attorney, told CNN that her client has been interviewed by the FBI.

“At the time he didn’t even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,” Blumenthal said. “It just happened to have captured twelve seconds of what transpired outside of his building.”

While it is difficult to clearly make out whether 10 or 11 shots are fired, Blumenthal told CNN she believes she heard 11.

Details surrounding the recording are unclear, including why it is emerging over two weeks after the shooting.

It is also unclear at what point the man began recording the message that captured the gun shots. Witnesses as well as law enforcement officials have said that Wilson fired one and perhaps two isolated shots in his police cruiser before numerous shots were fired outside of the car. The new audio seemingly does not capture the one or two shots fired inside Wilson’s cruiser.

Wilson has reportedly claimed that the gun went off in the cruiser during an altercation with Brown in which the 18-year-old shoved him into the car, assaulted him, and struggled to grab the weapon.

After the altercation in the car, witnesses say that Brown fled. From there, Brown’s movements and Wilson’s response are also unclear.

Wilson reportedly claims that after pursuing Brown, the man turned around to face him, taunted him and then began charging before Wilson fired the fatal shots.

Some witnesses say that Wilson began shooting after Brown fled. At that point Brown turned around in order to surrender but Wilson continued firing the fatal shots anyway, the witnesses said.

In a press conference shortly after the shooting, St. Louis County police chief Jon Belmar said that Wilson fired “more than just a couple [of shots]” but provided no further detail.

According to a CNN report filed days after the shooting, witnesses claimed that they heard up to 10 shots. Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown’s who was with him during the shooting, told of only a few.

A medical examiner who performed a private autopsy on Brown determined that he was shot at least six times. He had eight wounds on his body, but two may have been re-entry wounds.

It was initially reported that the altercation and shooting followed an argument after Wilson ordered Brown and Johnson to get out of the middle of the road. But it later emerged that Brown had stolen cigars and shoved a store clerk just minutes before he encountered Wilson. Wilson reportedly says that seconds after their first encounter, he received the police dispatch call reporting the strong-arm robbery and then doubled-back to confront the two.

The Po River and Delta are known for massive wels catfish, but anything bigger than 6.5 feet is considered extremely rare, and this one measured 8.8 feet.

The U.K. Mirror reported that Ferrari’s fish could possibly be the world’s biggest wels catfish caught with a rod and reel, though records of this sort are difficult to confirm.

The Mirror and NT News reported that the biggest wels catfish ever recorded was a 9.1-footer from the Po Delta, but they differ on its weight—one reporting it as 308 pounds, the other as 317 pounds. The method of that catch is uncertain.

Sportex Italia, Ferrari’s sponsor, called his fish the “world record spinning torpedo,” which might mean it’s a world record for a Torpedo spinning rod made by an Italian manufacturer, though it also simply says it’s a “world record in the spin fishing for catfish.”

Regardless, Ferrari’s fish is one of the biggest wels catfish recorded in recent history.

Ahead of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington, reports emerged that Islamist militias took control of nearly a dozen jetliners last month after the airport was the scene of a fierce battle.

On Sunday, the Libyan government announced that they had lost control of the capital to the militants, who include the Islamic groups Ansar al Sharia - which has ties to the Islamic State - and Libyan Dawn, an umbrella group for Islamist militias.

The country is currently witnessing its worst spasm of violence since former dictator Muammar Gaddafi was toppled and killed in 2011. Intelligence officials have been told in the last two weeks of the possibility that one of more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month, according to the Washington Free-Beacon.

""There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,"" one official told the Free-Beacon. ""We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.""

Damaged airplanes on the tarmac at Tripoli international airport

September 11 not only marks the anniversary of the World Trade Centre and Pentagon attacks; it will also be the second anniversary of the Islamic militant-led raid of the US Ambassador's compound in Benghazi, Libya when four Americans, including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens, were killed.

In July 2014 fighting broke out in the area of Tripoli International Airport, Libya as anti-government and pro-government militias were engaged in fighting. As a result, Tripoli Airport was closed for air traffic and many aircraft were damaged as result of the devastating fighting.

Al Jazeera reported that the planes are now being held by a group called the Masked Men Brigade who plan to use them in terror attacks.

Moroccan military expert Abderrahmane Mekkaoui told Al Jazeera there is ""credible intelligence"" that the Masked Men Brigade ""is plotting to use the planes in attacks on the Maghreb state' on the 9/11 anniversary.""

A commander for the Libyan Dawn group said earlier this week his forces had entered and been in control of the US Embassy compound in Libya's capital since last week.

A video posted online showed men playing in a pool at the compound. In a message on Twitter, US Ambassador to Libya Safira Deborah said the video appeared to have been shot in at the embassy's residential annex."
"190","Variety is reporting that Seth Rogen's got the part as Woz in Jobs, the upcoming Aaron Sorkin-penned take on the Apple icon. Christian Bale had already been cast in the title role, and this new addition... it's surprising, but kinda great.

Danny Boyle of Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later, and Trainspotting fame will direct the drama—which at one point was going to be a David Fincher affair—and it sounds like the whole film will offer a somewhat unconventional approach to the life of this tech icon.

Sorkin told Business Insider earlier this year: ""It's not a biopic."" Okay! So, that already sets it apart from the Ashton Kutcher joint. But also: ""It's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that."" It's been rumored that the whole film will be three looong backstage scenes set right before big product launches, so maybe that means an epic walk-and-talk sequence that spans the full feature-length?

I know some folks had their heart set on Jonah Hill, but I'm down with Rogen. Woz, we know you're out there: What say you? [Variety]"
"193","Leak Wars: director is fed up with plot details leaking from the set of The Force Awakens
LAST UPDATED AT 14:41 ON Tue 10 Feb 2015
Unconfirmed reports from Movie Pilot and Ikwiz suggest that director JJ Abrams wants to bring forward the release of the hotly anticipated forthcoming Star Wars film, Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens, to this summer.

The rumour comes from an industry event – the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015 – where Abrams is said to have told attendees he was frustrated with the slow drip of leaks from the set.

According to Movie Pilot, Abrams is worried that the leaked images and plot details will ""ruin"" the film before it gets to fans. Ikwiz says: ""Disney is reportedly taking Abrams's request very seriously, and is looking at a possible summer release.""

The film has been scheduled for release in December this year – with the next two instalments in the series following in 2017 and 2019, according to Disney boss Bob Iger.

Releasing The Force Awakens in the summer would be ""an extremely brave move"" says Movie Pilot, as it would put the latest Star Wars up against box office heavyweights including Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron, Ant-Man and the long-awaited Jurassic World."

"200","Breitbart Texas reports:

An Islamic Tribunal using Sharia law in Texas has been confirmed by Breitbart Texas. The tribunal is operating as a non-profit organization in Dallas. One of the attorneys for the tribunal said participation and acceptance of the tribunal’s decisions are “voluntary.”

Breitbart Texas spoke with one of the “judges,” Dr. Taher El-badawi. He said the tribunal operates under Sharia law as a form of “non-binding dispute resolution.” El-badawi said their organization is “a tribunal, not arbitration.” A tribunal is defined by Meriam-Webster’s Dictionary as “a court or forum of justice.” The four Islamic attorneys call themselves “judges” not “arbitrators.”

El-badawi said the tribunal follows Sharia law to resolve civil disputes in family and business matters. He said they also resolve workplace disputes.

In matters of divorce, El-badawi said that “while participation in the tribunal is voluntary, a married couple cannot be considered divorced by the Islamic community unless it is granted by the tribunal.” He compared their divorce, known as “Talaq,” as something similar to the Catholic practice of annulment in that the church does not recognize civil divorce proceedings as ending a marriage.

An Examiner.com article seems troubled by this.

This, though, is a perfectly normal practice within religious groups in America. El-badawi is right that Catholics have long gone to Catholic authorities to resolve certain questions related to marriage. Orthodox Jews have long gone to Jewish religious courts (such a court is called a “beth din”) both to resolve marital matters and to resolve commercial disputes. Some Protestants sometimes do the same; 1 Corinthians 6:1 is often interpreted as calling for that.

There are three ways in which these tribunals’ decisions have practical effect.

1. Parties’ respect for the system: Religious people may often feel personally obligated to follow the judgments of respected authorities on their religious law. For instance, a Catholic who doesn’t get an annulment might feel obligated not to remarry, even if he thinks that he should have gotten the annulment, simply because he feels that God wants him to follow the church’s teachings and decisions.

2. Social pressure: Would observant Muslims feel pressured to abide by a sharia tribunal’s ruling, when that will affect how their coreligionists, business partners, neighbors, and family members perceive them? You bet. Would Orthodox Jews feel the same? You bet, and I expect that Christians who operate within sufficiently devout and religiously homogeneous communities would have the same reaction. For an interesting, but rare, case of the legal system being asked to intervene to stop such social pressure and refusing to do so, see Paul v. Watchtower Bible & Tract Soc’y (9th Cir. 1987). (I think that, even in the absence of the Free Exercise Clause that were made in that case, but that might be unavailable in many states following Employment Division v. Smith (1990), a campaign urging people to shun the excommunicated would be protected under the Free Speech Clause, see NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co. (1982).)

Indeed, one common argument in favor of religiosity is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations (not to steal, not to commit adultery, and more). The flip side is that community pressure tends to lead people to abide by religious obligations that we might not agree with (stay with a husband who mistreats you, never remarry, and so on). Of course, if there is also the threat of violence and not just community pressure, then the law can step in to punish the violence, and any explicit threats of violence. But the possibility of such violence in rare cases doesn’t allow the legal system to step in to block nonviolent social pressure in other cases.

3. The parties could also enter into a binding arbitration agreement, under which they agree that the tribunal’s decision would be enforceable in civil court. Such agreements are common with secular commercial arbitration, even when the arbitration is supposed to apply law other than American law (e.g., English law or French law). And they are also permissible for religious arbitration.

There are interesting questions about whether an arbitral decision is enforceable in secular American court if it applies substantive or procedural rules that discriminate based on race, religion or sex. I discuss this a bit in this post, and the comments to it are also much worth reading. But according to the Breitbart Texas article, El-badawi says that these tribunals do not conduct legally binding arbitrations; rather, their decisions are followed — when they are followed — as a result of the parties’ acquiescence and community pressure. As a result, these interesting questions don’t arise here.

Religious communities have long had the right to use standard American contract law — coupled with the standard American liberty to exert social pressure on your family members, friends, neighbors and business partners — to have religious decisionmakers decide disputes. That’s especially so when the decisions are enforced just by community members’ own religious feelings, or by social pressure. But that can also be so, subject to some limitations, when the parties to the dispute agree to binding arbitration (which, again, doesn’t seem to be in play with the Texas Islamic tribunal).

The remedy for those who disapprove of the religious law is leaving the community (or the religion). That is of course often very hard, for personal and economic reasons. It’s hard for Muslims. It’s hard for Orthodox Jews (and especially groups such as the Satmar Hasidim). It’s hard for Mormons, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Amish, and members of lots of other groups. But that’s a necessary aspect of American social and religious freedom."

Sources familiar with HBO’s plans told IBT that Apple TV was among the devices that the streaming service, to be called HBO Now, would be available on at launch. The price for the service, which like Netflix would not require a pay-TV subscription, would be $15 monthly, sources said.

When contacted, HBO offered this statement: “We know there’s great anticipation around our stand-alone streaming service. And when we have details to share, we will do so.”

Back in October, HBO CEO Richard Plepler said the network planned to debut a stand-alone streaming service in 2015. Various reports, including IBT‘s Wednesday suggest HBO wants service up and running when its series Game of Thrones returns April 12 for its fifth season.

“It is time to remove all barriers to those who want HBO,” he said at the time.

The schoolgirls, from the city of Banja Luka, went to the Bosnia and Herzegovina capital, Sarajevo.

Nenad Babici, the national coordinator for reproductive health of the republic, told Inserbia.info that it was discovered that the seven schoolgirls got pregnant on the school trip.

The school in Banja Luka had taken 28 girls to the nation’s capital city for a five-day trip to visit museums and historic sights in the city, ranked among the finest in the world.

Furious parents are demanding to know why there was such a lack of teacher supervision, reported the Daily Mail.

However, Babici blamed parents for not educating their children properly.

He said that early sexual relations later lead to adverse consequences such as infertility, various diseases, miscarriages and premature births.

Senad Mehmedbasic, a Sarajevo gynecologist, said a growing trend of underage pregnancies in Bosnia and Herzegovina is worrying.

“That is the trend of today. But we cannot continue to allow our children to be educated about sex on the street and not in school,” he told Inserbia.info.

Educational institutes and parents, he said, should play a stronger role in providing effective sex education.

“It is obvious that children do not have enough knowledge of health education, so they engage in such activities, not knowing the consequences.

“We have to be more direct in the educational system, it must not be allowed that street teaches children about intimate matters, and that they are later slapped by life.”

"205","New York (CNN) -- When war reporter James Foley wasn't writing for GlobalPost or recording video for AFP or appearing on the PBS ""NewsHour,"" he occasionally shared stories on his own blog, aptly titled ""A World of Troubles.""

For a subtitle, he chose the famous Carl von Clausewitz sentence ""War is fought by human beings.""

And that is exactly what Foley sought to show with his reporting: humanity amid the horror of war.

Foley was abducted while on a reporting trip in northern Syria in November 2012. He was never heard from again.

A video published Tuesday by the extremist group ISIS showed Foley being beheaded. It is not known when or where the video was recorded.

For Foley's family and friends, the recording was the answer they hoped they'd never hear to their questions about his disappearance.

""We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people,"" his mother, Diane, said Tuesday night,

She called him ""an extraordinary son, brother, journalist and person.""

Courageous, generous

Foley was the oldest child of Diane and John Foley of Rochester, New Hampshire. He had four siblings.

Foley -- Jim to his friends -- had been reporting from war-torn countries for the better part of four years when he disappeared in Syria.

On Tuesday, fellow journalists remembered him for his courage and his generosity.

One of his friends, Alex Sherman of Bloomberg News, wrote on Twitter that he was a ""funny, warm, Big Lebowski-loving guy.""

Another friend, Max Fisher of Vox, praised his ""dedication to truth and understanding.""

Fisher also wrote that ""Jim's faith was something we all agreed not to discuss publicly while he was held in Syria, but it was the wellspring of his generosity,""

He recalled how Foley helped to organize a memorial fund for a photographer, Anton Hammerl, who was killed in Libya in 2011.

Foley had been traveling with Hammerl and two other journalists at the time, and the three who survived wound up in a Libyan jail.

Beheading of American journalist James Foley recalls past horrors

Front-line journalist

Foley was freed six weeks later. Afterward, in a video interview with the Boston Globe, he hesitated to make the story about himself, remarking at one point that ""you don't want to be defined as 'that guy who got captured in 2011.'""

""I believe that front-line journalism is important, you know -- without these photos and videos and first-hand experience, we can't really tell the world how bad it might be,"" he said.

One of the journalists detained with Foley in Libya, Clare Morgana Gillis, said his fundraising for Hammerl's family was ""the same impulse that compelled him to cut short his much-needed break from reporting in Syria when a colleague went missing last summer, and to raise money for an ambulance for Aleppo's Dar al-Shifa field hospital, where he spent weeks filming the plight of doctors who struggled to save lives with minimal space equipment.""

His time as a teacher

For Foley, these were acts of service, not entirely unlike his time spent in the Teach for America program. He began teaching in Phoenix in 1996.

""He'd promise students that he'd take them to the Castles and Coasters amusement park if they would come to class everyday,"" a fellow Teach for America alum, Sarah Fang, recalled in an essay in 2013.

Foley later ""taught reading and writing to inmates at the Cook County Sheriff's Boot Camp in Chicago,"" according to a Columbia Journalism Review feature about him.

Would you watch the video?

His journalism career

In the mid-2000s he decided to pursue a journalism career, first by enrolling at Northwestern University's well-respected Medill School of Journalism and then by embedding with American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. While preparing for his first embed, he started his blog.

Foley freelanced for a number of news media outlets, including GlobalPost, a world news Web site founded in 2009.

In 2012, he gravitated toward the spiraling conflict in Syria.

Fang, who kept in touch with Foley after their years teaching in Phoenix, wrote that his interest in the story there did not surprise her.

""He's always been willing to step into a zone where no one else wants to go,"" she wrote. ""Jim feels that society needs reporters willing to bear witness and report back the facts of history-in-the-making. And his loyalty to his colleagues meant that he wanted to be there with them on the frontlines.""

BuzzFeed Middle East correspondent Sheera Frenkel said she last saw Foley about a week before his final trip into Syria.

Drinking beers at the lobby of a hotel popular among journalists, they talked, she said, about ""how hard it was to move on from this job, into a life which would allow for marriage and family.""

""He was a generous colleague, never holding back a tip, phone number, or detail that could help, and could spend hours talking over the ins and outs of a story to get it just right,"" Frenkel wrote in an email message.

""Jim was a great journalist, and I think he'd like to be remembered that way, first and foremost.""

After the news of Foley's killing spread on Tuesday, CBS News foreign correspondent Clarissa Ward changed her profile picture on Twitter to a photo of Foley wearing a helmet, a flak jacket and holding up a camera.

This, she said, ""is how I will chose to remember James -- as a brave and tireless journalist with a passion for the Syrian cause.""

"209","A Taliban commander exchanged for the release of a POW attempts to return to the battlefield, raising questions about closing Guantanamo

When U.S. President Barack Obama agreed in May to exchange five Taliban detainees from Guantanamo Bay for Bowe Bergdahl, a U.S. soldier who had been held captive for five years, his political opponents had a field day. They warned that the detainees risked returning to Afghanistan, and to militancy. Obama, with the backing of the government of Qatar that had agreed to host the men, promised that they would be kept far from the battlefield. Seems that the men may have had other ideas. According to CNN, U.S. military and intelligence officials now suspect that at least one of the detainees has made contact with Taliban associates in Afghanistan, suggesting that he, and perhaps the others, may be planning a return.

Considering that 29 percent of all U.S. detainees who were held in the Guantanamo detention center are either suspected of or confirmed to have returned to the fight, according to a March 2015 assessment by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, it shouldn’t be all that surprising. TIME’s Massimo Calabresi predicted as much back in June, just after Bergdahl was released. The recidivism rate, he wrote, “suggests that statistically at least one of the Taliban leaders will return to the field to fight Americans in Afghanistan, or elsewhere.”

At the time of the exchange, Taliban commanders who had been involved in Bergdahl’s capture, captivity and release, told TIME that the exchange — five of theirs for one of America’s — would encourage them to seek out more P.O.W.s. So far, that hasn’t happened. It’s not clear which of the five former detainees was reaching out to associates in Afghanistan, but as high-ranking commanders and former comrades-in-arms of Taliban leader Mullah Omar, any one of them could galvanize a movement that is slowly making gains in the wake of the U.S. drawdown in Afghanistan. Even if those plans have now been foiled, the incident may have one other far reaching consequence: as Obama attempts to close down Guantanamo for good, his opponents now have more ammunition for why he should not.

"210","Hailed as a hero: Sergeant-at-Arms Kevin Vickers. Photo: Reuters

Ottawa: As Canada comes to terms with finding itself in the firing line of militant Islamists it turned for reassurance to a 58-year-old former Mountie formerly best known for carrying a golden mace.

As parliament's sergeant-at-arms, Kevin Vickers' role is largely ceremonial, symbolising the authority of the body and keeping order in the chamber wearing a bicorne hat and tail coat.

But on Wednesday, when a lone Islamist gunman stormed the building, he put pomp and circumstance to one side, found a gun and fired the shots that brought the rampage to an end.

He was back in the chamber on Thursday, a humble hero at the centre of attention, applauded to the rafters by members of parliament.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper crossed the floor to shake his hand. Opposition leader Tom Mulcair praised his ""heroism"".

Mr Vickers took charge of security on Parliament Hill - a collection of government buildings overlooking the Ottawa River - in 2006, after a 29-year career in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

He was an experienced officer, reaching the rank of chief superintendent, but he is not usually armed.

So when Michael Zehaf-Bibeau charged through the front doors of parliament he reportedly had to return to his office to open the lockbox where he kept his handgun.

The attacker had already shot a security guard in the leg in an exchange of gunfire and had run down the Hall of Honour towards the library, where he took cover in an alcove next to Mr Vickers' office.

Mr Vickers reportedly emerged, threw himself to the ground to present a smaller target, and shot the assailant three times.

It was the first time he had ever shot anyone, a family member told local media.

""He always put his nation and his community first and foremost,"" his brother John said.

""We're just tremendously relieved he's OK and very, very proud of him and what he had to endure today.""

Video images showed Mr Vickers calmly walking back to his office, his automatic pistol still in his hand at his side.

He is said to have entered a nearby conference room where Conservative MPs had been holed up to reassure them: ""I put him down.""

""Thank God for Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers,"" Justice Minister Peter MacKay said in a Twitter message.

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino also said he was ""profoundly grateful"" to Mr Vickers and to security forces for their ""selfless act of keeping us safe"".

One senator called him a hero while reporters heaped praise on him for his quick actions that ""saved lives"".

""Remind me to hug Kevin Vickers the next time I see him,"" said Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reporter Kady O'Malley.

In a statement, the humble officer said he was ""very touched"" by all the attention but said it must be shared with his ""remarkable security team"".

""Yesterday, during extraordinary circumstances, security personnel demonstrated professionalism and courage. I am grateful and proud to be part of this team,"" he said.

The son of a dairy farmer and a nurse, he was born in Chatham, New Brunswick.

The letter was first posted by Reddit user fryd_, who said he unearthed the letter ""with his niece and nephew at their Grandma's house"" in a box with a ""blonde girl on the front with a white Lego house.""

But like everything on the Internet, the legitimacy is being questioned. The writers at iO9 are less skeptical, pointing to the letter's use of Lego's 1970s logo, which is slightly different than the one used presently. As for further evidence for authenticity, Lego's ads in that era used similar fonts. Lastly, there's a German version of the letter that reads almost identical to this one.

The evidence is convincing that it's legitimate and it would be a bizarre thing to fake. It's a compelling statement to make for the 1970s — and more importantly, it still holds true today.

An Indian man accused of trying to rape a teenager reportedly had his penis lopped off by vigilante locals after they allegedly heard the girl’s screams.

Suresh Kumar, 40, is now recovering in hospital after he was apparently dragged into a butchers shop in the city of Ganganagar, in India’s Rajasthan state.

He had allegedly been seen pinning the petrified girl to a wall, which is when he was pulled off and taken to a store to have his genitals hacked off with a meat cleaver.

The appendage was reportedly thrown into the road, with officers now hunting down the perpetrators. He is understood to be in a critical condition, while the girl was treat for shock.

Aamir Dhawan, 30, a local, said: “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime,” according to the Daily Mirror.

He added: “We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped.

“This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that - if you do it you will be punished.”

The Daily Mail reports a police spokesperson as saying: “As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice.

“We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”

The Indian government has been accused of not doing enough to protect its citizens, as violent attacks against girls and women become increasingly condemned by the international community.

Meenakshi Ganguly , South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch, wrote in the Hindustan Times in August that “knee-jerk solutions like death penalty for rapists and lowering the age of a juvenile from 18 to 16 will not help end sexual violence against women.”

She added: “Instead of hasty measures, the government should make a commitment to effective law enforcement and the more difficult and lengthy steps needed to reform the criminal justice system.”

Recent incidents include a 15-year-old teenage girl who was gang-raped and murdered in India in September, and a six-year-old girl who was raped at a school in Bangalore in July."
"217","International experts have raised doubts as to whether a 12m-wide (40ft) crater near the Nicaraguan capital, Managua, was caused by a meteorite.

Nicaraguan officials announced on Sunday that a ""small meteorite"" had come down near the airport.

But Nasa scientists say the fact that no-one reported seeing a fireball in the sky would suggest it was caused by something else.

So far no meteorite fragments have been found in the crater.

'Like a bomb'

Locals said they heard a large blast just before midnight local time on Saturday and reported a burning smell.

A crater 12m wide and more than 5m deep was later found near Managua's international airport.

An adviser to Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies (Ineter), Wilfried Strauch, said he was ""convinced it was a meteorite"" which caused the impact.

But Head of Nasa's Meteoroid Environment Office Bill Cooke said that ""for something to produce a hole in the ground that big, it would have generated a very bright fireball, and nothing was reported"".

Managua has a population of 1.2 million people and many residents reported hearing a loud bang and feeling a shock wave.

Victor Gutierrez, a mechanic who lives less than a kilometre from the site of the crater said that he ""heard the explosion and felt the shockwave, which was very strong''.`

But he stressed that he ""didn't see anything in the sky either before or after.""

Jaime Incer, a scientist who advises the Nicaraguan presidency on environmental matters, said it was possible nobody was looking up at the sky when the event took place close to midnight.

'Alternative explanations'

Nasa's Bill Cooke estimated that the crater would have been created by a blast of ""roughly the energy equivalent of 1 tonne of TNT [explosive material]"".

In his blog on the NASA website, he said that a meteor capable of such force would have created a fireball visible over a wide area.

On Sunday Ineter scientist Jose Millan had insisted that ""all the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event"".

""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact,"" he added.

Government spokeswoman and First Lady Rosario Murillo said the crater was created by a ""relatively small meteorite"" that ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth"".

But Nasa asteroid expert Don Yeomans said the impact felt in Managua ""was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of [asteroid] 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated"".

Mr Cooke said there could be any number of alternative explanations, ranging from ordinance to ""someone out blowing things up"".

"218","The leader of the Catholic Church has assured pet lovers across the world that dogs do go to heaven.

Speaking at his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for our furry friends, along with 'all of God's creatures.'

The head of the Catholic Church had been attempting to console a distraught young boy who was mourning the death of his dog, according to Time magazine.

Pope Francis confirmed that there is a place in heaven for dogs and 'all of God's creatures' during his weekly address in the Vatican's St. Peter's Square

The statement is at odds with conservative Roman Catholic theology which states that animals cannot go to heaven because they have no souls.

Francis was quoted by Italian news media as saying: 'One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.'

The remarks have been warmly welcomed by animal rights groups such as PETA and the Humane Society.

The issue of whether animals have the chance of an afterlife has been debated for centuries.

Pet owners will welcome the Pope's remarks that their beloved dogs, cats, horses and other furry friends have a place in heaven

Pope Francis has refused to meet the Dalai Lama over fears it could impact on the Catholic Church's relationship with China.

The exiled Tibetan leader requested the meeting during a visit to Rome but it was declined 'for obvious reasons concerning the delicate situation' with China.

The Catholic Church in China is divided in two; the official Church overseen by the Chinese Communist Party, and an underground community that swears allegiance to the Pope.

But the main bone of contention is over which side should have the final say in the appointment of bishops.

A Vatican official said the Pope's decision was 'not taken out of fear but to avoid any suffering by those who have already suffered'.

The longest serving Pope - Pius IX - who was the leader of the church from 1846 to 1878 believed animals had no consciousness and therefore could not have an afterlife.

Pope Francis's predecessor, Pope Benedict XVI, had also denied the idea of pets entering heaven and said their death simply meant the end of their existence on Earth

But it is perhaps unsurprising that Pope Francis, aged 77, supports the idea of pets and animals having a place in paradise as he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

It's not the first time Francis, an Argentine Jesuit who took over from Pope Benedict XVI last year, has courted controversy.

The leader is seen as more liberal than his predecessors and his lenient positions on homosexuality and unwed couples have caused a stir in the conservative members of the church."
"219","Syrian activists claim militants from the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) seized earlier this week a cache of weapons airdropped by U.S.-led coalition forces that were meant to supply Kurdish fighters battling the extremist group.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the militants seized at least once cache, but may have seized more, the Associated Press reported.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to ISIS, the agency said.

The video appeared authentic and corresponded to The Associated Press' reporting of the event.

The Observatory, which bases its information on a network of activists on the ground, said the caches were airdropped early Monday to Kurds in the embattled Syrian town of Kobane that lies near the Turkish border.

The militant group has been trying to seize the town for more than a month now, causing the exodus of some 200,000 people from the area into Turkey. While Kurds are battling on the ground, a U.S.-led coalition is also targeting the militants from the air.

On Tuesday, ISIS loyalists on social media posted sarcastic thank you notes to the United States, including one image that said, “Team USA.”

But the badly-aimed weapons drop was more an embarrassment than a great strategic loss. The ISIS militants already possess millions of dollars-worth of U.S. weaponry that they captured from fleeing Iraqi soldiers when the group seized swaths of Iraq in a sudden sweep in June.

Also Tuesday, Syrian government airstrikes hit a rebel-held town along the country's southern border with Jordan, killing at least eight people on Tuesday.

Activists with the Local Coordination Committees (LCC) and the Britain-based Observatory said the number of those killed was likely to rise as there are more victims under the rubble.

The LCC said Syrian government planes dropped crude explosives-laden canisters on the town of Nasib on the Syria-Jordan border.

The air strikes are part of battles between Syrian government forces and Islamist rebel groups for control of the area.

Syrian government forces have been heavily bombing rebel areas in recent weeks, while the U.S-led coalition has been conducting air strikes against ISIS militants elsewhere in Syria.

"220","FORT DEVENS, Massachusetts -

Infamous Boston Marathon bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 21, was the victim of an “unfortunate accident” yesterday at Ft. Devens Detention Center in Massachusetts, just weeks after his high-profile trial began, according to warden Paul Jacobson.

Corrections officers reportedly found the alleged terror suspect face down in a pool of his own blood in his cell; a banana peel was found on the floor nearby.

“It initially appeared as though Tsarnaev slipped on a discarded banana peel and hit the floor with such force that his head bounced off the hard tile surface, probably 16 or 17 times. There was blood everywhere – all over the walls, the floor, even the toilet. The injuries have caused massive brain trauma,” said prison investigator Joe Goldsmith. “We determined though, through expert analysis, that it would be impossible for these injuries to have occurred through a fall. Our investigation has shown that that it was the Aryan Brotherhood who initiated an attack on Tsarnaev.”

“Yes, it was the brotherhood who took care of that bomber,” said Miles Smith, head of the Aryan Nation inside Devens. “The other gangs, they wanted him, too. We paid the guards the most money to have a shot. They stood aside, and let us do what we do. On the way out, they shook our hands, told us ‘Thank you.’ Well, You’re welcome. You’re welcome, Boston. You’re welcome, America!”

“Normally, an attack this violent, this cruel, on another inmate would get any offending party more time added to their sentence,” said warden Jacobson. “Because of the nature of Tsarnaev’s crimes, though, we have decided to actually reduce the sentences of the Aryan members who were involved. They have done our prison and our country a great service, and we appreciate it immensely. They are heroes in the eyes of not only this institution, but also in the eyes of the people of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.”

Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev were both suspected of perpetrating the Boston Marathon bombings on April 15, 2013. The bombings killed three people and reportedly injured as many as 264 others. Shortly after the FBI named the two suspects and released images of them, the two brothers reportedly killed an MIT police officer and carjacked an SUV in a shootout with police. During the shootout, the elder brother, Tamerlan was captured but was killed when his brother drove over him with the SUV. On the evening of April 20, 2013, the wounded Dzhokhar was found unarmed and hiding in a boat on a trailer in Watertown, Massachusetts.

On January 30, 2014, United States Attorney General Eric Holder announced that the federal government would seek the death penalty against Tsarnaev. The trial had just begun on January 5, 2015, as Tsarnaev pleaded not guilty to all thirty charges filed against him."
"221","Updated at 11:45 p.m. ET

There was an unexpected crash landing near the international airport in the Nicaraguan capital over the weekend, but luckily no one was hurt: A small meteor, thought to have broken off from an Earth-passing asteroid, left a 40-foot-wide crater.

The meteorite — which experts say may have disintegrated on impact — smashed through a wooded area outside the airport in Managua, leaving a 16-foot-deep hole.

""We thought it was a bomb because we felt an expansive wave,"" Jorge Santamaria, a resident in the area of the impact, was quoted by The Associated Press as saying.

The AP quotes Nicaraguan government spokeswoman Rosario Murillo as saying the meteorite was relatively small and ""appears to have come off an asteroid that was passing close to Earth.""

Nicaragua will ask international experts to help local scientists in understanding what happened, the AP says.

""All the evidence that we've confirmed at the site corresponds exactly with a meteorite and not with any other type of event,"" Ineter scientist Jose Millan was quoted by the BBC as saying. ""We have the seismic register which coincides with the time of impact, and the typical characteristic that it produces a cone in the place of impact.""

According to the BBC:

The asteroid was discovered on Aug. 31 by the Catalina Sky Survey near Tucson, Ariz., and independently detected the next night by the Pan-STARRS 1 telescope, located on the summit of Haleakala on Maui, Hawaii, according to a NASA statement issued last week.

The statement said that on closest approach, the asteroid was to have been one-tenth the distance from the center of the Earth to the moon, or about 25,000 miles, away."
"224","'A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard'

Not everyone at magazine publisher Condé Nast was thrilled on hearing the company was going to become the new flagship tenant of the brand new World Trade Centre skyscraper where the Twin Towers once stood. Some felt spooked by the tragic history of the site. They didn’t reckon on rats.

But one month after decamping from their old HQ off Times Square, the glamorous crews of titles like Vogue and Vanity Fair are waging a daily battle against a positive rat rampage. All employees have been banned from eating at their desks for fear of dispensing inadvertent treats to the roaming rodents.

Sources have told the Daily News that Vogue editor Anna Wintour, who likes a world of red carpets and sparkle not droppings and thick tails vanishing into cracks, has refused to show up in her office until the problem is bought under control.

While rat sightings are common in New York City’s ageing subway system, few would have imagined their invading a building as brand new and prestigious as One World Trade. But there they are, it seems, in ever multiplying numbers, happily scaling what is now the tallest building in the Western hemisphere.

""A bunch ate through the ceiling of a sports editor's office and crawled all over his desk and left poops on his keyboard,"" one company source told the Daily News. ""They ate through his rug to fit under his door."" Another disgusted staff member told the paper that the rats at Vogue had essentially “taken over”.

It’s not quite the start that Graydon Carter, Editor-in-Chief, had imagined either. Ambushed by a Daily News reporter outside the tower he was asked whether the rats were a disgusting as everyone has been saying. “They’re rats,” he replied. “What do you think?”"
"225","The Indian government has sacked a civil servant who went on leave in 1990 and never came back to work.

Urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu said a case of ""wilful absence"" had been proved against electrical engineer AK Verma.

Mr Verma had been under investigation since 1992, but had refused to co-operate, the minister said.

Correspondents say absenteeism is a pervasive problem in government-run offices in India.

Mr Naidu said in a statement that Mr Verma joined the Central Public Works Department in 1980.

He had risen to the rank of executive engineer by 1990, when he went on leave.

An inquiry was set up in 1992, but formal proceedings to dismiss him were not begun until 2007.

It took a further seven years for the department to reach a decision and dismiss him.

It is not clear whether he was paid during his time off.

Falling absenteeism

India's bureaucracy has become notorious for high levels of absenteeism.

A report in 2012 labelled India's government machinery the worst in Asia.

Schools have also faced problems, with teachers failing to turn up for work in huge numbers.

Last August, a state school in Madhya Pradesh sacked a teacher who had been absent for 23 years of her 24-year career.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi promised to curb slack working practices when he took office last year.

The AFP news agency reports that he makes unannounced visits to government offices, and absenteeism has since plummeted."
"226","WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. airstrikes earlier this week killed the leader of the al-Shabab terrorist group in Somalia, the Pentagon said Friday. President Barack Obama said the death of Ahmed Abdi Godane demonstrated U.S. counterterrorism resolve and was an example of his deliberate approach to dismantling al-Qaida affiliated groups.

The Pentagon's press secretary, Navy Rear Adm. John Kirby, announced the death in a brief written statement. It took the Pentagon four days to conclusively determine that Godane had not survived Monday's airstrikes.

Al-Shabab has not publicly confirmed Godane's death.

Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud urged al-Shabab militants to renounce violence, saying they have an opportunity to embrace peace following Godane's death.

""While an extreme hardcore may fight over the leadership of al-Shabab, this is a chance for the majority of members of al-Shabab to change course and reject Godane's decision to make them the pawns of an international terror campaign,"" he said in a statement.

The Somali president said the U.S. operation was carried out ""with the full knowledge and agreement of"" his government and that Somalis ""greatly value the support of our international allies"" in the fight against al-Shabab.

Obama, speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit in Newport, Wales, told reporters the success against al-Shabab should leave no doubt about his determination to degrade and eventually destroy the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. The U.S. military announced later Friday that a mix of fighter jets, drones, attack planes and bombers launched four airstrikes Thursday and Friday in northern Iraq, destroying a host of Islamic State targets including an observation post, an armed vehicle and three mortar positions.

Obama faces mounting pressure to take more aggressive military action against the Islamic State, which evolved from an al-Qaida affiliate that sprouted in Iraq in 2004.

""We have been very systematic and methodical in going after these kinds of organizations"" that threaten U.S. personnel and the homeland, Obama said. ""That deliberation allows us to do it right, but have no doubt: We will continue to do what is necessary to protect the American people.""

U.S. officials had said after the strike on Monday that U.S. special operations forces using manned and drone aircraft had destroyed an encampment and a vehicle using several Hellfire missiles and laser-guided munitions. But they did not confirm that Godane had been killed until Friday.

The State Department declared al-Shabab a terrorist organization in February 2008. The implications of the group's loss of Godane are unclear.

""The individual who takes his place will live in fear,"" said Army Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman.

Because Godane had weakened and effectively dismantled the al-Shabab council of leaders known as the shura, a meeting of regional commanders will have to take place to pick his successor, said Matt Bryden, the head of Sahan Research in Nairobi, Kenya. Bryden predicted the meeting will be difficult and dangerous to organize.

Terrorism analyst J.M. Berger predicted a significant splintering between al-Shabab's domestically focused insurgents and internationally aspiring terrorists.

Abdi Aynte, a Somali analyst who runs a Mogadishu-based think tank called the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies, predicted that Godane's death ""will almost certainly be the beginning of the end of the organization.""

Under Godane's leadership, he said, al-Shabab had gradually become a guerrilla movement that avoided conventional warfare, tactics that suited it amid mounting military pressure from African Union troops and government forces.

Godane, who was born in 1977 and raised in the town of Hargeisa in the autonomous region of Somaliland, was said to be a quiet boy who was interested in the Quran and Islamic studies in his early years. His relatives there described him as ""a private man"" who was devoted to Islamic teachings at mosques, said Mohamed Hassan, a former senior Somali intelligence official in Somaliland who once was tasked with tracking down Godane over charges the future terror leader stole money when he worked for a local telecommunications company. In Somaliland, he also had been accused of involvement in the murder of foreigners.

Godane is believed to have settled in Mogadishu in 2004, working at local charities before he joined the Islamic Courts Union, al-Shabab's precursor group that once controlled Mogadishu and many parts of Somalia before it was ousted by Ethiopian forces.

"227","LAGOS — A wave of violence hours after Nigeria's government announced a truce with Boko Haram raised doubt on Sunday about whether more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the Islamist militants will really be released, deflating the new hopes of their parents.

Nigeria's armed forces chief Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced the ceasefire on Friday to enable the release of the girls, who were abducted from the remote northeastern village of Chibok in April.

But Boko Haram has not confirmed the truce and there have been at least five attacks since — blamed by security sources on the insurgents — that have killed dozens. Talks were scheduled to continue in neighboring Chad on Monday.

""We were jubilating. We had every reason to be happy ... but since then the ceasefire has been broken in quite a number of places already,"" Lawan Abana, a parent of the one of the missing girls, told Reuters by telephone.

He added that there were doubts about the credentials of the reported Boko Haram negotiator Danladi Ahmadu, who was unheard of before. ""Can we trust him that he can deliver on this promise of releasing the girls when he has not delivered on the promise of the ceasefire?"" Abana said.

The government says the attacks may not have been Boko Haram but one of several criminal groups exploiting the chaos of its insurgency. Analysts point out that Boko Haram is anyway heavily factionalized, so what matters is whether the faction the government is talking to has control over the girls' fate.

"228","Sex-selecting abortions are nothing new. They happen all the time in China, for example. While they undoubtedly happen in the United States, people don’t brag about them. At least they didn’t.

It’s hard to believe this is real, but according to the website “Injustice Stories,” a woman named Lana, a self-described feminist, boasted of aborting her baby because it was a boy. Then, after making that declaration, claims to be shocked that some people might have a problem with that.

Lana, who only uses her first name, appears to be a child of privilege. She boasts of involvement in “fighting for women’s rights” being all-consuming, “even to the point of eschewing a career.” Yet that lack of a career hasn’t stopped her from travelling to “many different places” to continue that “fight.

She tells the story of a flight to an Occupy Wall Street event in San Francisco where she screamed “Assault” because the man sitting next to her said “B******* like you need to learn their place.”

Putting the unlikeliness of that exchange aside, Lana then demanded to be moved to another seat. That’s when she was told the only empty seats were “both back in economy.” At which point she demanded the man be moved.

When the flight attendants came running, one of whom was male, they refused to force the man to move because he hadn’t done anything. Lana, regretfully, relented and, in tears, moved herself.

The encounter left her “having felt as though I had been verbally and emotionally raped.”

That flight, according to Lana, left her forever changed. “By the time we landed, my outlook had changed, I could no longer depend on men to be an ally of the cause,” she wrote.

Lana was pregnant at the time, and thought she “had a good idea” who the father, or as she puts it, “the donator” happened to be. She was convinced she was having a girl because, well, she wanted a girl. Or at least a baby with a vagina, the “gender” part would be up to the child. “I had already started buying gender neutral clothing since I did not want outside influences affecting what gender she would ultimately become,” she writes.

After researching all-girl daycares and schools with the plan to make sure that “No man will be around to hurt her progress, no boys there to demean her or call her names,” Lana got horrible news from her doctor – her baby had a penis.

She spent the next two days in fit of crying rage. How could this happen to her? She says, “My home became my prison and my fetus became my warden.”

Within a few days she had aborted the baby. “My body’s betrayal was no more, I was free, and for the first time since the airplane incident, I felt strong,” Lana claims. “I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good.”

Lana informs readers that she is now the mother of “a beautiful 1 year old female who will hopefully grow up to be just as strong and driven as her mother.”

She ends her post with:

I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.

The backlash was immediate, and harsh. Lana, much to her shock, was on the receiving end of negative comments and even death threats.

At the request of the editors of the website, Lana returned to answer critics. She was as unrepentant the second time as she was the first."
"229","The highest paid 'performer' on You Tube, who is said to earn almost $5m a year unwrapping toys, is a former porn star called Sandy Summers, neighbours have told DailyMail.com.

Brazilian Daiane DeJeus was named by a family friend as the woman behind the wildly successful collection of children's videos that have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times.

And former neighbours of the mysterious internet star have revealed to Daily Mail.com her secret past - which could explain her desire to remain completely anonymous.

For years they knew her as Daiane DeJesus who lived in a suburban home with her long-term partner Messias Credido.

But they also discovered she was once a porn star called Sandy Summers.

Scroll down for video

DeJesus' videos, in which a mysterious woman 'unboxes' toys while narrating as she does so, have been watched a staggering 2.8billion times on YouTube, bringing the 29-year-old an annual income of almost $5m

The Brazilian went by the name Sandy Summers but is now living under the name Daiane de Jesus

Are these the hands of DC Toys Collector? Daiane DeJesus and her husband are apparently behind the site that has become a YouTube sensation

Seen here with a Teletubbies toy, the woman's nails always appear differently in each DC Toys Collector video

The couple behind DC Toys Collector - previously known as 'Disney Collector' and one of the most popular videos on YouTube - has gone to extraordinary lengths to make sure their identities are not known.

Attempts by the New York Times and BuzzFeed website to establish their identity failed, though they were able to pinpoint Florida as the location of those behind the channel - which is nothing to do with Disney itself.

But Daily Mail.com has been told the identities of the pair by former neighbours and a close friend - and has used publicly available property records.

Former neighbours who listened to the videos of DC Toys Collector are convinced that DeJesus is the voice behind You Tube's most successful channel.

They became aware of her career as adult film star after she was spotted taking part in a photo shoot by the swimming pool in her back garden.

They also watched some of the graphic adult-only videos and instantly recognised the pouting young blonde as their suburban neighbour.

DeJesus, 32, never mentioned what she did for a living and the neighbours never asked.

Daily Mail.com tracked DeJesus, who quit the porn industry at least seven years ago, to her new home in an upscale gated community in Orlando, Florida.

Four people who were independently shown a photograph of DeJesus taken by Daily Mail.com this week and published here said that it was their former neighbour.

They pointed to a tell-tale scar on her left elbow and a mole just above her elbow joint as being identical to those that can be seen on Summers in many of her lingerie photo shoots.

One neighbour who listened to the DC Toys Collector video and said immediately: 'That is Daiane. She has a very childlike voice and I would recognize it anywhere.'

The neighbour, who declined to be named, said: 'Most people in the street eventually knew what she was up to.

The videos are essentially a virtual tour of each toy, such as this Play Doh with a Finding Nemo theme

Maribel Barreto, an associate and ex-wife of Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido, was approached by Daily Mail.com and showed the photos of DeJesus and Summers. She said they are behind the DC Toys Collector videos

'Her husband said he ran a photographic business but he never left the house. That was strange.

'We just thought they were so secretive we thought something had to be going on.

'Then someone said we should look at Sandy Summers' website and it all clicked into place.'

His wife added: 'In the photo you have of Daiane she has put on a bit of weight but that is unmistakably her.

'That is our former neighbour. I used to chat with her quite a lot and was shocked when I learned what she did and what might have been going on at the house.'

Another neighbour, who is in his 70s and asked not be named, said no one in the quiet suburban street spoke to DeJesus or her husband about their work in the porn industry.

'We heard what they did but it was none of our business,' he said.

Credido's ex-wife Maribel Barreto was also approached by Daily Mail.com and viewed the photos of DeJesus and Summers.

When asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen-faced and hurried away.

'I have nothing to say,' she said as she sprinted into her apartment.

But Barreto, who was divorced in 2011, had earlier confirmed that her ex-husband and his wife Daiane ran the DC Toys Collector site from their home in Orlando.

She said: 'Yes, they are the Disney Collectors. I can't say any more.'

While DeJesus has done nothing illegal, many parents who allow their children to watch the videos might be dismayed to learn about the other graphic videos and photo shoots DC Toys Collector apparently took part in a decade ago.

Attempts by Daily Mail.com to speak with DeJesus and her husband have failed as they have no phone listing and they do not accept unsolicited callers to the gated community where they now live.

Neighbours in the upscale gated community confirmed that they know the blonde woman who lives with Messias Credido as Daiane DeJesus.

The couple, who have an 18 month old son, were married on December 26th 2013, according to records lodged with Seminole County Court.

Credido, who is also from Brazil, is behind another successful You Tube site called BluCollector.

It is identical to the DC Toys Collector channel except it focuses mainly on toys for young boys.

Both the BluCollector and the DC Toys Collector site are produced in exactly the same way.

Shipping receipts seen by Daily Mail.com show toys being sent from Germany to the home address of Credido.

Former neighbours in the Orlando suburb of Winter Springs where DeJesus and Credido lived said they would see deliveries from UPS and Fed Ex almost daily at their home.

'There would be delivery trucks up to three times a day. We all wondered what was going on and what was being dropped off,' said a neighbour.

Credido has been named as the man behind the Blu Collector by other media outlets.

But until now the identities behind DC Toys Collector have been a closely guarded secret.

The videos first began appearing on YouTube in 2012.

They quickly became an online sensation attracting millions of page views and popular with children aged three and under because of their simplicity.

The most watched video is called 'Play Doh Sparkle Princess' and has had more than 200 million views.

Five other videos have received more than 40 million views, and another 15 have more than 20 million.

The channel's 1,600 videos have been watched more than 2.4 billion times since being uploaded.

One of the most recent, called 'LUNCH BOX SURPRISE Magnetic Dress-Up FROZEN', has already notched up more than 260,000 page views.

The DC Toys Collector channel has more than 3.7m subscribers with a new video posted almost every day.

Like others on YouTube, DC Toys Collector is able to make money from the site from pop-up and banner adverts on the site.

With so many children watching the videos on a daily basis it is an obvious choice for companies advertising toys to place their adverts within the short videos.

Each time the DC Toys Collector site is watched, the producers are paid.

Industry experts say they get between .60cents and $5 each time the page is viewed.

Google, which owns YouTube, takes 45 per cent of any money earned.

The company Open Slate, which analyses YouTube, estimated that in 2014 DC Toys Collector earned $4.9m.

They reached the figure by looking at the account's subscribers, social media reach and average monthly view count.

In the videos DC Toys Collector's face is never seen. Viewers only ever see her hands and hear her slightly accented voice.

Each video always begins with the words: 'Hey guys, Disney Collector here'.

The narrator, who has a slight accent, regularly uses the words 'adorable' to describe the toys and carefully unwraps each item before explaining its features.

The videos are expertly produced with professional sound and lighting.

A focal point of the videos are the brightly coloured fingernails that often feature toy characters intricately painted on them.

The videos are said to have an entrancing effect on children who sit mesmerized as the toys are slowly opened in front of their eyes.

Technology strategist David Williams told the NBC Today show in July 2014 that the effect on kids, including his own, was like 'crack for toddlers'.

He told the show: 'The effect is somewhat akin to crack for toddlers because of how you see them pining for it after it's over'.

Williams also told Buzz Feed: 'I call it first-person toy porn. I think it works because it's Christmas morning every minute.'

Others have called the DC Toy Collector 'The Toy Whisperer'.

But the couple have gone to great lengths to guard their privacy. No phone number is listed and their names are not even on the phone entry system at the gated community where they now live in Orlando.

Property records listed with Seminole County list 44-year-old Credido as the buyer of a four-bedroom home set on a cul de sac in Orlando in April 2013.

DeJesus' name does not appear on the records.

Neighbours in the development contacted by phone confirmed that DeJesus lives at the address and is mum to an 18-month-old boy.

According to fan websites DeJesus, or Summers, began her porn career when she was 20 years old in 2006.

She lists her hometown as Lages in Santa Catarina, Brazil, and her date of birth as April 1986.

On a webpage called Babepedia she says: 'I was born in a small town in Brazil called Lages. I love the sun, so when I moved to the US Florida seemed like the right place.

'I miss some of my friends in Brazil, but I just love living here! I enjoy the simple life, but big cities have so much to offer; shopping for one! I am a shopoholic, definitely!

'I speak Portuguese and English. What else can I say about myself? Just that I love to get naked.'

In her career she has appeared on the cover of Penthouse magazine and other adult magazines as well as dozens of graphic videos.

It appears she quit or reduced her involvement in the adult film business in 2009 with one fan asking on a site: 'Anyone know what has happened to Sandy Summers?'

Daily Mail.com tracked down Daiane DeJesus' partner Messias Credido's former wife Maribel Barreto

Ms Barreto confirmed that Mr Credido and Daiane de Jesus are behind the DC Toys Collector videos. She is pictured being shown a document with the reported annual income of DC Toys Collector

But when asked if DeJesus and Summers were the same person the 44-year-old went ashen faced and hurried away

Some of the photographs of Summers on adult sites appear to have been taken at their home in Winter Park.

Many of the backdrops in the pictures are identical to those now being shown on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

In one she is draped across a stone fireplace. That same fireplace is pictured on the estate agent's webpage advertising the home for sale.

DeJesus and Credido, who ran a now defunct photographic business called High Tec Photography, lived in Winter Park for almost seven years.

The couple aroused the curiosity of neighbours as they were ultra secretive.

One said: 'Messias said he was a photographer but he never left the house. They always made sure that no one would come into the house.

'They were friendly when you bumped into them in the street, but they would not go out of their way to be talkative.'

Another said: 'Word soon got around that Daiane was involved in some sort of adult work. No one liked to ask any questions but once we knew her working name we looked her up.'

Publically available records with Seminole County show that the couple moved in April 2013 from Winter Park to a gated community in Orlando, paying $690,000 for a four-bedroom home.

Daily Mail.com knows the exact location but has declined to publish it.

It is also possible that Ms Barreto works with the couple on the DC Toys Collector website or even plays the part of the hands herself. However, she claimed to DailyMail.com that the couple are behind the production of the videos.

Credido has also recently paid $300,000 for a plot of land in another gated community where he is expected to build a multi-million dollar home.

Records filed with Seminole County court show that DeJesus and Credido were married on December 26, 2013. DeJesus is listed as a single woman while Credido is divorced.

Her birth date is listed on the official form as April 1982 - four years different that Summer's on adult film websites containing her biography

Daily Mail.com has attempted to speak with the couple but they have declined to return any calls."

"232","Apple will offer a low power mode on Apple Watch to help boost it through longer days, according to a new report that also takes a stab at dispelling rumors that the company may have elected to all some long-rumored sensors last minute.

With the exception of Pebble products, most current and upcoming smartwatches - including the Apple Watch - will last no more than a day on a single charge. To help mitigate this issue, Apple has reportedly developed a still unannounced software feature of the Apple Watch called Power Reserve, according to the New York Times. It's said to cut power to all non-essential functions and display only the time, helping to extend the watch's life in cases where a recharge may not be possible. The function is similar in concept to the Battery Saver mode in Android 5.0, which can push smartphone battery life from minutes to hours by reducing processor use.

Apple previously stated that the Watch's battery should last only a normal day, requiring a fresh charge at night. Although standard among smartwatches, the issue has created controversy, since many had been hoping Apple would solve the smartwatch industry's battery woes with its inaugural effort.

The report also notes that despite some recent claims to the contrary, Apple's decision to abandon some advanced health tracking features came over 18 months ago, rather than at the last minute. Early experiments in tracking factors like blood pressure and stress are said to have been ditched after the sensors proved unreliable and otherwise unworkable. Instead, the first-generation device only features motion and heart-rate sensors, once again mirroring some competing smartwatches.

The Times also highlights some of the challenges that faced the Apple Watch's development cycle, noting that Apple not only encountered technical difficulties in achieving its ideal design but was also forced to battle the loss of key engineers, some of whom were poached by Google-owned home automation outfit Nest Labs. Among them was Bryan James, who became an Engineering vice president at Nest early last year.

Chief among some of the later challenges was keeping a tight lid on secrecy surrounding the product while simultaneously deploying evaluation units into the real world, for which Apple engineers created dummy casing, including some resembling Samsung smartwatches.

Apple is due to reveal more details about the Watch at a San Francisco press event on March 9th. AppleInsider will be offering live coverage of the event as it progresses."
"234","Christian Bale will not be playing Steve Jobs in the upcoming movie about the Apple co-founder, Hollywood Reporter reports.

Sources say the actor decided he wasn't right for the role, and withdrew.

This is coming after the movie's scriptwriter Aaron Sorkin confirmed that Bale would be playing the prickly tech icon, saying the actor didn't even need to audition.

No word if this'll affect Seth Rogan's negotiations to play Steve Wozniak, but this throws a huge wrinkle into the Danny Boyle-helmed adaptation of Walter Isaacson's critically acclaimed biography of Jobs. If they get desperate to bring Ashton Kutcher back into the turtleneck, we'll know things have taken a dark turn.

Who would you rather see play Jobs? I liked Bale for the role, but my backup choice is Stanley Tucci, if they can age him down somehow for younger scenes. Or Bradley Cooper, who has the right kind of nervous energy to spit out Sorkin's rapid dialogue. [via Hollywood Reporter]"

"239","Holy Motor City gossip! The rumored theft of the Batmobile in Detroit appears to be a false alarm.

Detroit police spokesman Sgt. Michael Woody said that police confirmed with producers of “Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice” that the vehicle has not been stolen, a rumor that proliferated on the web and social media on Friday.

“The Batmobile is safe in the Batcave where it belongs,” Woody said.

Sources close to the production being filmed in metro Detroit also said it wasn’t true that the Caped Crusader’s ride had been stolen.

Buzz about the supposed theft swirled Friday when at least one comic book website reported on the “scuttlebutt” that one of the Batmobile models had disappeared and was presumed stolen.

The rumor was greeted and retweeted with smirking skepticism by some — and insert-your-own-Detroit-joke comments by others.

The Warner Bros. production has been working hard to keep its activities under wraps while filming in and around Detroit. But that’s not always easy when the cast and crew leaves the relative lockdown of the film’s headquarters at Pontiac’s Michigan Motion Picture Studios.

Unauthorized photos of the Batmobile have been hitting the Web this week – an unwelcome reality for studios in a world where everyone with a smartphone is a potential paparazzi. Director Zack Snyder also tweeted an official photo.

"243","An alleged bug in iOS 8 appears to be deleting documents stored in iCloud Drive without the user's permission.

Discovered by MacRumors after complaints surfaced from users of the blog site's forums, the bug is triggered by the option to Reset All Settings.

Found in the Reset screen under the General category in Settings for iOS 8, the Reset All Settings option is supposed to simply reset your iOS settings but leave your data and media untouched. Yet several forum users say that's not the case as certain iCloud documents also vanished after they reset all settings.

Based on user comments, the bug seems to be specific to documents from iWork apps, such as Pages, Keynote, and Numbers, MacRumors said. One user reported that his iWork documents were deleted after resetting all settings, but other data files remained in iCloud.

""HELP,"" one user wrote. ""Because iOS 8 was so sluggish on my iPad 3 I reset all settings (No data or media will be deleted) and sped it up BUT deleted my iWork data! Then promptly synced and deleted it in iCloud.""

""I just had this happen to me,"" another forum user wrote. ""I had a bit of weird behaviour on my iPad, so I figured it wouldn't hurt to just reset all settings. For the hell of it, I did it on my iPhone as well. ALL DOCUMENTS LOST! How on earth does resetting settings (with a clear notice that data will not be lost) wipe out iCloud drive? It's embarassing.""

Apple's Time Machine feature is supposed to automatically back up your files so you can restore any that are lost. A couple of users said they checked Time Machine but were unable to retrieve the lost iCloud Drive files. However, a third person reported success with Time Machine, at least running the beta of OS X Yosemite. Several of the affected users say they've contacted Apple support personnel, who are investigating the issue.

MacRumors ran its own test on the bug and reported the following:

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well. Preview and TextEdit documents, which cannot be accessed on the iPhone, remained untouched on the Mac.
iCloud Drive is Apple's answer to Google Drive, Microsoft's OneDrive, and other cloud-based storage services. Beyond just syncing your files between your iOS devices and iCloud, you can directly store and retrieve documents and other files on iCloud Drive just as you can store and retrieve them locally.

"244","A Catholic priest from Massachusetts had been dead for 48 minutes before he was miraculously resuscitated. However, it is his description about God that is bound to spark a hot debate about the almighty.

Father John Michael O’Neal was officially declared dead for more than 48 minutes, but medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. According to the 71-year-old man of God, the supreme entity isn’t a man, as is popularly assumed and believed. Father O’Neal claims he met God during the brief time he was officially dead and God is a woman.

The catholic father claims God is a warm and comforting motherly figure. The revelation will undoubtedly have a profound bearing on the teachings of Christianity, which firmly believes and even implies that God is a male figure who has watched over us with love and devotion. Though the love and devotion part is corroborated by Father O’Neal, he differs from the church’s teachings about the gender of God.

Father John Micheal O’neal had the chance to meet with the divine when he was rushed to a hospital late last month owing to a massive heart attack. However, Father O’Neal was declared clinically dead shortly after his arrival. Not one to give up hope so easily, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital kept the blood flowing to his brain with the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2.

While the blood flowed with the help of modern science, doctors worked tirelessly to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm. Consistent with near-death experiences, Father O’Neal entered heaven through a gate made of bright light and encountered God. However, instead of the all-mighty father figure, the priest claims he was warmly greeted by a motherly figure. Father O’Neal describes the divine entity as “mother-like ‘Being of Light.'”

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting. She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

As expected, the priest’s claims about the gender of God has created quite a stir amidst devote Catholics. The intense discussion between the catholic clergy of the archdiocese about the “experience” of the father and the ramifications of his revelations persuaded the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.

Though his superiors have disapproved, Father O’Neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother.”

“I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

Given the potency of Father O’Neal’s alleged experience, it is quite likely he might face some resistance and criticism. However, he is prepared, assures the priest.

While she was given a male name she is actually intersex which means she had male genitalia but no testicles.

At the same time she also has a uterus and no ovaries.

From a young age she knew that she was in fact female and started to dress as a girl.

In her teens she used testosterone blockers and estrogen enhancers.

During this period her name was changed – she initially changed it to Paige Victoria Whitney.

She left home age 15 and by 16 she became legally emancipated from her family.

When Taylor was 18 she got in trouble with the police twice – for a bad cheque and then a DUI.

The following year she revealed she “thought it would be smart to blackmail someone” into giving her money for her surgery.

But as soon as she got the money she was arrested and charged for extortion.

Taylor was forced to spend 30 days in jail – during which time she said she was ‘too ashamed’ to tell any of her family members.

Despite both her birth certificate and drivers licence proving she was female, she claims she was put in a cell with three men and was raped.

At some point in her twenties she underwent surgery to remove her male genitalia.

Since then she has campaigned for gender rights.

In 2001 Taylor was involved in an 'horrific' car accident which made her change her goals.

Following a lengthy recovering period she returned to school to study sign language interpreting - and did a two year ITP.

She went on to get a degree in social and behavioural sciences.

In 2004 her dream of opening an online consignment shop came true when she launched Chandler's Designer Consignment.

By 2013 she had found her calling in life - working in crisis management and has consulted on numerous hight profile cases.

In August 2014 Taylor says she met Michael Phelps via the dating app Tinder and they stared to start.

On September 30 2014 her relationship with Olympian Michael was made public and she rose to prominence.

By that time she had fell in love with the swimmer who checked into rehab in September after being arrested for DUI.

Taylor found it was too difficult to continue interpreting after she was in the public eye.

Since telling him she was born intersex she is worried she will lose him.

On 14 November she announced on Facebook that she was an intersex baby.

According to Wall Street Journal, Apple has “studied platinum watch casings,” which could be the material of choice for the luxury edition of the next-generation Watch. For the current Watch, the most expensive variant will boast 18-Karat gold plating. While Apple hasn’t revealed any details about the pricing, reports claim that it could go up to the $20,000 mark.

Considering that luxury watch makers like Rolex and Omega use platinum for their high-end watches, it seems like a logical step up for Apple as well. But the publication mentions that Apple has only been “studying” the materials, and this is by no means a confirmation about a platinum Watch variant.

"254","The right-hand man of Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi was killed by an airstrike in Mosul.
An airstrike in the ISIS stronghold of Mosul killed at least two members of the group, including an aide to ISIS leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi, according to the Iraqi Defense Ministry.
Reports that Baghdadi himself had been killed by a U.S. airstrike circulated in Turkish and Kurdish media Wednesday and were repeated to The Daily Beast by multiple Iraqi sources. But a Pentagon official denied that the ISIS leader was dead. ""There is no validity to the rumor that we've killed Baghdadi,"" a senior defense official told The Daily Beast.  

The Iraqi Defense Ministry announcement, first reported by al Arabayia, did not specify whether the airstrike was carried out by American or Iraqi forces, but NBC News reports that a senior security official confirmed it was a U.S. airstrike. The article does not clarify whether the security official is American or Iraqi but quotes them as saying that three ISIS leaders were killed, including Baghdadi’s aide Abu Hajar Al-Sufi, an explosives specialist and commander in the town of Tal Afar.

There have been no public statements yet from U.S. officials on the reported airstrikes.

While the U.S. air war in Iraq has been steadily expanding since it began in early August, Thursday’s reports provide the first public indication that ISIS’s senior leadership is being directly targeted.

The rumors of Baghdadi’s death that spread through northern Iraq yesterday may have been triggered by uncertainty over who died in the airstrikes that reportedly killed his aide. It’s also possible that claim’s of Baghdadi’s death could have come from ISIS itself as part of a deception campaign to cover the leader’s tracks and obscure his true status and whereabouts.

Multiple sources, including Kurdish intelligence officials and former Iraqi army officers, told The Daily Beast Wednesday that Baghdadi had died somewhere in Syria after being wounded in a recent airstrike and fleeing Iraq to seek medical treatment.

This was not the first time that rumors of Baghdadi’s death have surfaced. Without an independent press to verify new information, unverified claims can be spread quickly through Iraq as speculation outpacing facts and gets taken for the truth.

But the new reports that ISIS leaders were killed by airstrikes in Mosul, coming only a day after a flurry of claims about Baghdadi’s death in Syria, suggests the group’s leadership is increasingly vulnerable and that Baghdadi may be on the run and seeking sanctuary in Syria where President Obama has not yet authorized military intervention.

"255","Is there a pet door on the Pearly Gates?

During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, Pope Francis comforted a young boy who was distraught over the recent death of his dog by telling him, ""One day, we will see our animals again in the eternity of Christ,"" the 77-year leader of the Roman Catholic Church said, according to Time. ""Paradise is open to all of God’s creatures.""

The statement by the pope was welcomed by animal rights groups and humane societies across the globe, who see it as a repudiation of traditional Catholic teaching dating back hundreds of years that holds that animals can’t go to heaven because they have no souls.

""My inbox got flooded,"" Christine Gutleben, senior director of faith outreach at the Humane Society, the largest animal protection group in the United States, told the New York Times. ""Almost immediately, everybody was talking about it.""

Some Catholic scholars, however, have warned that the Pope’s comment was made casually and should not be taken as official Church doctrine. Others point to earlier comments that seem to suggest that Pope Francis has long held beliefs that animals can go to heaven.

""He said paradise is open to all creatures,"" Father James Martin, a Jesuit priest and editor at large of  the Catholic magazine America, told the Times. ""That sounds pretty clear to me.""

The statement has also stirred up debate between vegan groups and their counterparts in the meat industry – with groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) saying the pope’s statement aligns with the view of heaven as a peaceful place and could convince more Catholics to avoid eating meat.

""It’s a vegan world, life over death and peace between species,"" said Sarah Withrow King, director of Christian outreach and engagement at PETA. ""I’m not a Catholic historian, but PETA’s motto is that animals aren’t ours, and Christians agree. Animals aren’t ours, they’re God’s.""

Pope Francis’ statement worried many in the multi-billion dollar meat industry, for whom the idea of Catholics not buying meat – especially those holiday hams and turkeys in the lead up to Christmas – equals a potentially large loss of revenue.

""As on quite a few other things Pope Francis has said, his recent comments on all animals going to heaven have been misinterpreted,"" Dave Warner, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, told the Times in an email. ""They certainly do not mean that slaughtering and eating animals is a sin.” 

Mr. Warner quoted passages from Genesis that say man is given “dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over every living thing that moves on earth.""

Father Martin couldn't see how the pope's comments could be interpreted as a proclamation about vegetarianism, but, he said, ""[The pope] is reminding us that all cre"

"263","A photo purporting to show the slain body of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi appears to be a doctored picture of another slain militant killed in Syria in 2013.
Rumors circulated on social media and Iraqi media over the weekend that Baghdadi was slain in a US airstrike several days ago.
Later Iraqi reports said the IS leader was severely wounded in the chest near the Syrian border and was receiving medical treatment.

The reports could not be independently confirmed.

A picture purporting to show Baghdadi’s bloodied body in fatigues also circulated.

However, the picture appears to actually show Baghdadi’s head pasted onto the body of Sami Hafez Al-Abdullah, an Albanian national killed in Syria in 2013, according to an investigation by Storyful, a social media news agency.
A picture of Abdullah, who reportedly also served as an imam in Germany, and a report on his death appeared on Yemenite news site Hournews.net last year.

Despite the apparently doctored photo, Baghdadi’s fate, amid continuing American air strikes, remains unclear. 

Washington expanded its month-long air campaign to Iraq’s Sunni Arab heartland, hitting Islamic State fighters west of Baghdad as troops and allied tribesmen launched a ground assault on Sunday.

The new strikes deepen Washington’s involvement in the conflict and were a significant escalation for President Barack Obama, who made his political career opposing the war in Iraq and pulled out US troops in 2011.

Previous strikes — since the US air campaign began on August 8 — had been mainly in support of Kurdish forces in the north.

US warplanes bombed IS fighters around a strategic dam on the Euphrates River in an area that the jihadists have repeatedly tried to capture from government troops and their Sunni militia allies.

“We conducted these strikes to prevent terrorists from further threatening the security of the dam, which remains under control of Iraqi security forces, with support from Sunni tribes,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby said.

“The potential loss of control of the dam, or a catastrophic failure of the dam — and the flooding that might result — would have threatened US personnel and facilities in and around Baghdad, as well as thousands of Iraqi citizens,” he added.

""The Ebola virus could be in any area in the world, including Mosul, where they don't have the measures or techniques to diagnose the virus,"" ministry spokesman Ahmed Rudaini said. ""They are incapable to detect it."" 
Though some Iraqi news outlets have confirmed cases of Ebola, the country's health ministry has denied the reports. 
""We have no official notification from [the Iraqi government] that it is Ebola,"" WHO director Christy Feig told Mashable.
If the ill patients are determined to have Ebola, it would be the first time an ISIS-controlled area has the virus. ISIS does not believe in modern medicine or science, making it a potentially problematic situation. 
""U.N. workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria,"" said Benjamin T. Decker, an intelligence analyst for Levantine Group. ""In this context, the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""

Stills from the purported Haines execution video were released to the Internet Saturday, al-Jazeera reported. In the footage, a masked man claims Haines was killed because the United Kingdom said it would arm Kurdish fighters to combat ISIS in Iraq.

“This British man has to pay the price for your promise, Cameron, to arm the peshmerga against the Islamic State,” the masked men reportedly said, addressing U.K. Prime Minister David Cameron. The video also contains a threat to second British hostage.

This time around, the message from the Islamic State is very much aimed at @David_Cameron, with a 2nd British hostage threatened.

The UK Foreign Office is ""working urgently"" to verify the authenticity of the alleged Haines beheading video, Sky News reports. If verified, the execution would constitute ""another disgusting murder,"" the government organization said.

Haines’ relatives pleaded Saturday with ISIS to “make contact” and respond to their messages, NBC News reported. “We are the family of David Haines,” the relatives said in a statement. “We have sent messages to you to which we have not received a reply. We are asking those holding David to make contact with us.”

The British aid worker was identified as ISIS’ next target for beheading in the video which showed the execution of American journalist Steven Sotloff. Militants vowed to kill Haines if the United States military did not end military operations against the Islamic State in Syria and Iraq.

A father of two, Haines was kidnapped in Syria while working with an organization that assists refugees from the country’s civil war, the New York Daily News reported. He was taken captive near the Turkish border."
"271","The Canadian government said on Sunday it was investigating reports that a Canadian-Israeli woman who joined Kurdish militias fighting in northern Syria has been captured by Islamic State (Isis) fighters.

According to a blog linked to Isis, several female fighters who fought alongside the Kurds have been taken prisoner, including Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-born resident of Tel Aviv. Israel Radio reported Kurdish sources denying the claims, saying Rosenberg was not in the area when it was attacked.

A Canadian government spokesman said in a statement his country was “pursuing all appropriate channels” as it sought further information and was in touch with local authorities.

Asked by an Israeli television station about the reports, the Israeli defence minister, Moshe Ya’alon, said: “I cannot confirm that and I hope that it isn’t true.” The Shin Bet, Israel’s general security service, told the Jerusalem Post: “There are no further details at this stage”.

Rosenberg, 31, joined Kurdish troops fighting Isis earlier this month. A former pilot who served in the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), she reportedly contacted Kurdish fighters over the internet before travelling through Iraq to train at one of their camps on the Syrian border.

In an interview with Israel Radio aired in November, Rosenberg said she was training with Kurdish guerrillas with the intention of fighting in Syria. “They are our brothers. They are good people. They love life, a lot like us, really,” she said.

On 20 November, a message posted to a Facebook page in Rosenberg’s name said: “My Facebook account and friend requests are being managed by someone else until I have access again in apx [sic] 2 weeks time on or around week of [8 December]. Please do not message as this is not me. Thank you.”

"272","A mother has been accused of cannibalism after she was allegedly found biting her newborn baby’s arm.

The woman, named locally as 24-year-old Li Zhenghua, was found trying to eat the child while in a hospital ward in Shenzhen, southern China, recovering from the birth.

Luckily a nurse saw the woman with her teeth locked around her son and raised the alarm.

The nurse, named as Liu Tianlun, attempted to prise the woman off the baby but the mother refused to let her child go.

She was eventually sedated and extracted from the baby.

A hospital spokesman said: ‘It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite.

‘Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart.

‘After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.’

The mother is believed to have been living on the street after being thrown out by her mother-in-law despite being pregnant.

She is believed to have been surviving on the streets for a number of weeks before going into labour and being taken to hospital.

Hospital staff are deciding whether to give the newborn back to his mother.

An investigation into the incident is ongoing."
"273","The Lebanese army detained a wife and daughter of Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as they crossed from Syria nine days ago, security officials said on Tuesday, in a move seen as likely to put pressure on the Islamist chief.

The woman was identified as Saja al-Dulaimi, an Iraqi, by a Lebanese security official and a senior political source.

The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported she had been detained in co-ordination with “foreign intelligence.”

A Lebanese security source said the arrest was “a powerful card to apply pressure” in negotiations to secure the release of 27 members of the Lebanese security forces captured by Islamic militants in August near the Syrian border – a view shared by other Lebanese officials who confirmed the arrest.

A senior Lebanese security official said al-Baghdadi’s wife had been traveling with one of their daughters, contradicting earlier reports that it was his son. DNA tests were conducted to verify it was al-Baghdadi’s child, the official said.

They were detained in northern Lebanon. Investigators were questioning her at the Lebanese defense ministry.

There was no immediate reaction from Islamic State websites, although some of the group’s supporters rejected the report.

Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics said the arrest indicated that the American-led coalition seems to have solid intelligence in Syria and Iraq.”

“I talked to a few people who told me this was a coordinated arrest between American intelligence services and the Lebanese army,” he told Reuters.

“If I were Abu Bakr Baghdadi, I would be very anxious that they are getting very close,” he said. “This is a development … that is very alarming for ISIS, in particular the top leadership.”

Dulaimi was one of 150 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 nuns taken captive by al-Qaeda-linked militants in Syria, according to media reports at the time.

A source with contacts with Iraqi intelligence said the captured woman was an Iraqi wife of al-Baghdadi’s, but could not confirm the name. There was cooperation between Iraqi and Lebanese authorities leading up to her capture, the source said.

Al-Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.

Islamic State has declared a caliphate and seized wide areas of Iraq and Syria, Lebanon’s neighbor to the east.

The Lebanese security forces have cracked down on the group’s sympathizers and the intelligence services have been extra vigilant on the borders with Syria. They have arrested over the past few months dozens of Islamic militants suspected of staging attacks to expand Islamic State influence in Lebanon.

A U.S.-led alliance is seeking to roll back Islamic State’s territorial gains in Iraq and Syria. U.S. President Barack Obama has vowed to “degrade and ultimately destroy” al-Baghdadi’s group, which is seeking to reshape the Middle East according to its radical vision of Islam.

An Islamic State fighter denied that al-Baghdadi’s wife had been arrested. “I have checked with our leaders and they said it was false news. The Lebanese are lying,” he said from inside Syria.

Spillover from the Syrian conflict has repeatedly jolted neighboring Lebanon. Militants affiliated to the al-Qaeda-linked Nusra Front and Islamic State are demanding the release of Islamists held by the Lebanese authorities in exchange for the captured members of the Lebanese security forces.

The United States is offering $10-million for information leading to the location, arrest, or conviction of al-Baghdadi, an Iraqi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarai.

Al-Baghdadi called for attacks against the rulers of Saudi Arabia in a speech purported to be in his name last month.

He said his self-declared caliphate was expanding in Saudi Arabia and four other Arab countries and called for “volcanoes of jihad” the world over in the speech released on Nov. 13.

A CV of al-Baghdadi published on social media in July by Islamic State sympathizers described him as married but gave no further details.

Born in 1971, al-Baghdadi comes from an Iraqi family of preachers and Arabic teachers, according to a biography distributed on Islamist forums that says he studied at the Islamic University in Baghdad.

According to U.S. media reports, al-Baghdadi was detained for several years at Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq, before becoming head of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, a predecessor to Islamic State, which expanded into Syria in 2013.

In June this year, his group named him “caliph for the Muslims everywhere,” and called on all Muslims to pledge allegiance. Although he is rarely pictured, a video released in July showed him preaching in a mosque in the Iraqi city of Mosul.

The Lebanese authorities have also detained the wife of Anas Shirkas, senior Nusra Front leader from Syria, security officials said on Tuesday. They did not identify her."
"276","Gill Rosenberg, a Canadian-Israeli woman, who ISIS had claimed to have abducted, posted on Facebook Monday afternoon that she was “safe and secure.” On Sunday, contributors to a number of jihadist platforms had claimed that the Islamic State group had captured a “female Zionist soldier fighting with the Kurds against the Islamic State” from Kobani.

International Business Times was unable to verify that Rosenberg herself was responsible for the post.

Rosenberg, 31, who migrated to Israel from Canada in 2006, is believed to have served for two years in the Israeli military, according to a report by Haaretz. She had earlier claimed, through photos published on the same account, that she had joined Kurdish forces battling ISIS in Iraqi Kurdistan in the country’s north.

Jihadists believed to be loyal to ISIS had claimed on Sunday that Rosenberg, along with a number of female fighters, had been abducted near Kobani and that the Israeli military was deliberately trying to curb the news of her capture. However, a number of media outlets subsequently raised doubts over the claims, citing Kurdish sources, who said that Rosenberg was nowhere near Kobani.

""This is false propaganda by IS,” Kurdish sources told The Times of Israel. ""We can say with a high level of certainty that no Israeli volunteer, or any international volunteer for that matter, arrived to fight in the city of Kobani in Syria.""

The Israeli government, which on Sunday said it was investigating reports of her capture, had also stressed that the information was of “dubious credibility,” according to a report by The Times of Israel. “I cannot confirm that [report of Rosenberg’s capture] and I hope that it isn’t true,” Israel’s Defense Minister Moshe Ya'alon had reportedly said."
"277","According the latest in a string of scoops from 9to5Mac, battery life has been a pressing concern for Apple throughout the development of the Apple Watch. And for the first time, ""sources familiar with the Watch's development"" have provided some early figures on what consumers can expect when the device ships sometime this year. In short, Apple Watch will exhibit similar longevity to what we've seen from many Android Wear devices on the market today.

Apple was originally shooting to eke out an entire day of battery life from Apple Watch. Obviously that's not all active use; in fact, the company is said to be shooting for 2.5 to 4 hours of active application use with the screen turned on. That'll vary depending on how heavily you use it, of course. But since the wearable's display will often be turned off throughout the day — and because the iPhone handles a lot of computing tasks — Apple is apparently hopeful that the watch can make it from morning until you place it back on the wireless charger at night. 19 hours of combined active and passive use seems to be the bar as of right now.

THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE TO EXTEND A SMARTWATCH'S BATTERY LIFE

This isn't unlike what you'd get from the current field of Android smartwatches; use them constantly and they won't last a day. But that changes with more average use. Notably, the Pebble smartwatch continues to blow away the field in terms of battery life, but it's a very different device when compared against a Moto 360 or the Apple Watch. In standby and low-power modes, 9to5Mac's sources say Apple Watch can last through two or three days. And if for some reason you want to use it strictly as a timepiece and leave the screen on at all times, it'll die out after three or so hours. Using it as a workout companion? Your gym routine shouldn't last more than four hours.

Apple is reportedly testing Apple Watch's battery life aggressively — and in large numbers. 9to5Mac claims the company has distributed over 3,000 units as the development process continues. And while the iPhone is a critical companion to Apple Watch, the device itself may be more powerful than some expected. 9to5Mac says the CPU inside is more or less equally as powerful as the A5 chip that powered the iPhone 4S and iPad 2, and remains in the current-generation iPod touch. Considering the tiny form factor, we're expecting the same fluidity and responsiveness that have become hallmarks of iOS. But as for the battery, Apple can only do so much. The simple fact is that battery technology doesn't evolve at nearly the same rate as the smartphones in our pockets and wearables on our wrists. The company will undoubtedly keep pushing for improvements as Apple Watch's launch nears; it's expected to ship beginning in March."
"280","ISLAMIC State group jihadists are being trained by Saddam Hussein’s former pilots to fly three fighter jets captured from the Syrian military, a monitoring group says.

The planes, which are believed to be MiG-21 and MiG-23 jets, are capable of flying although it is unclear if they are equipped with missiles, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.

The jets were seized from Syrian military airports now under IS control in the northern provinces of Aleppo and Raqa, according to the Britain-based group, which has a wide network of sources inside the war-torn country.

It said that former Iraqi army officers who once served under Saddam were supervising the training at the military airport of Jarrah, east of the city of Aleppo.

Witnesses have reported seeing planes flying at a low altitude to avoid detection by radar after taking off from Jarrah.

It comes as the US and its allies carry out a wave of air strikes on IS positions in Syria and Iraq.

The jihadists also control two other airports in Syria — Albu Kamal near the Iraqi border and Tabqa in Raqa province.

IS has captured large parts of Syria and Iraq, committing atrocities and declaring an Islamic “caliphate”.

After the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, some Sunni former officers from Saddam’s army joined the ranks of the Islamic State of Iraq, a branch of al-Qaeda which later became IS.

Meanwhile, sniper and mortar fire from jihadists are preventing authorities from evacuating civilians caught up in the battle for the Syrian border town of Kobane, a local official says.

At the same time, Kobane district chief Anwar Muslim, said US-led air strikes had destroyed many Islamic State group vehicles and artillery pieces, and that the town’s defenders are reinforcing their positions.

“There are civilians trapped in the centre and south of town, whom we cannot evacuate because of snipers and mortar fire,” Mr Muslim told AFP on Friday.

“Their situation is difficult.”

There are no precise figures on how many non-combatants remain in Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab.

Last week, the United Nations spoke of as many as 700, mostly elderly, civilians being trapped in the centre of the town. Another 10,000-13,000 were said to be gathered near the Turkish border.

For its part, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights says there are hundreds of civilians in the centre and west of town and that many of them refuse to leave, preferring to die than go into exile.

The IS jihadists, who have seized swathes of Syria and neighbouring Iraq and declared a “caliphate,” first attacked Kobane on September 16 in a bid to seal their control of a long stretch on the Syrian side of the border.

They succeeded in taking nearly half the town before its defenders, aided by US-led air strikes, began pushing them back.

Describing the situation on Friday, Muslim said “you can see their bodies (IS jihadists) in the streets ... Our forces are reinforcing their defensive positions.”

The IS fighters are “mostly in the east and south, and have hidden their Hummers, artillery and tanks among the houses so as not to be targeted by the air strikes.”

He saluted what he called the “incredible resistance” of Kobane’s defenders, adding that the situation is still dangerous and that there is “no other choice but to resist.”"
"281","The wife and child of the Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State (Isil), have been arrested in Lebanon, security officials and Lebanese politicians said on Tuesday.

An Iraqi women, identified by local security sources as Saja Hamid al-Dulaimi was detained ten days ago at a checkpoint, along with Baghdadi’s son, north of the Lebanese town of Tripoli, a senior security confirmed to the Telegraph.

“She had crossed into Lebanon from Syria. She and her son were travelling on fake passports,” the source said.

The boy is said to be no older than 11 years of age.

Citing security officials, the Lebanese As-Safir newspaper said the child’s DNA had been tested and showed the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant jihadist group is his father.

Baghdadi’s DNA is likely to have been taken by US officials in the American run Camp Bucca prison in Iraq, where he was detained in 2004.

The newspaper said the arrests had been made after a tip off from a “foreign” intelligence agency, that is believed to belong to a Western government.

The wife and child are said to be currently being held in the Ministry of National Defence headquarters in Yarze, just outside Beirut.

Mrs Dulaimi was one of 138 women released from a Syrian government jail in March as part of a prisoner swap that led to the release of 13 Syrian nuns being held by Jabhat al-Nusra, al-Qaeda’s branch in Syria.

Though Iraqi, Mrs Dulaimi had reportedly detained along with three of her children during a military operation near the Syria capital Damascus.

Earlier this year a photograph was circulated online purporting to be of Mrs Dulaimi. It showed a young woman with a pale face, clearly defined cheek bones and large eyes. Her hair is covered in a black hijab.

The release of Mrs Dulaimi was repeatedly demanded by the al-Qaeda kidnappers of the nuns, who were captured from a convent in the Syrian Christian town of Maaloula.

One source close to the negotiations told the Telegraph that they had “insisted” that without her release negotiations “would not continue”.

Mrs Dulaimi’s second detention is likely to be a significant personal blow to Baghdadi and could be used as a bargaining chip against his group, which has captured many foreign, Iraqi and Syrian prisoners and declared a caliphate in territory it has seized in Syria and Iraq.

Baghdadi has three wives, two Iraqis and one Syrian, according to tribal sources in Iraq.

Earlier this year the Telegraph visited the ramshackle neighbourhood of Tobchi in Baghdad, where Baghdadi, whose real name is Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim al-Badri, spent his early years.

A resident who had played football alongside Baghdadi, when they were both part of a team formed by the local mosque, said he had married shortly after completing his doctorate at the Islamic University in Baghdad at the start of the millennium.

The resident, who asked not to be named recalled that his wife had given birth to a son within less than a year of the marriage ceremony. His son is now approximately 11 years old, matching the age of the boy reportedly captured in Lebanon.

There were some contradicting and unconfirmed reports that the child captured may have been a girl.

Syria's civil war has killed more than 200,000 people in less than four years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said on Thursday."

“Bono really should ask Tim Cook about the Apple Watch’s battery life.” I tweeted that yesterday during the U2 frontman’s awkward vaudeville routine with Cook onstage Tuesday at Apple’s biggest event in years. We were clearly moments away from its end and we hadn’t been told how long the company’s first wearable will run on a single charge. Expected battery life was a glaring omission in an otherwise impressive parade of features and specs. And after ignoring it completely during the Apple Watch’s onstage debut, the company stalwartly refused comment on it during the device demos that followed.

There’s a good reason for that. Sources tell me that Apple isn’t yet happy with the watch’s battery life, which isn’t going to break any industry standards. “It’s about a day right now,” said one, adding that Apple is working on various modifications ahead of the device’s 2015 launch to improve it. Reached for comment, Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris declined to provide an estimate on expected battery life, but said the company expects users will charge their Apple Watches once daily. “There’s a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,” Kerris said. “We anticipate that people will charge nightly which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.”

Domestic abuse, a crime that victimizes 1.3 million women a year according to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, is not an issue that men at the NFL seem capable of addressing, discussing, or addressing their discussion. According to the NCADV, ""In 70-80% of intimate partner homicides, no matter which partner was killed, the man physically abused the woman before the murder.""

It's men committing it, men not punishing them for it, men not losing their jobs over mishandling it. The end result has been some of the NFL's worst public relations, ever. But ESPN, a sports network that will stop at nothing to free the NFL of this shame, is about to step in and make it all better with a bold plan: Send in more men.

Eleven men, to be exact, who will fill out a panel prior to the Chiefs playing the Patriots tonight on Monday Night Football. The panel will discuss, among other things, domestic abuse and the NFL.

Remember, 1.3 million women are victimized by domestic abuse every year, but none of them will be on the panel. Ray Lewis will be, though. As will Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Stuart Scott and Steve Young. Esquire has a proper shaming here.

How have some of these guys reacted to Ray Rice and Adrian Peterson's domestic abuce scandals and Roger Goodell's gross mishandling of them?

""Look, the NFL did not create these problems. The people in the NFL created these problems. The players. It’s not the commissioner. It’s not the owners. These kids are given the opportunity to make a lot of money and to play football. Now, if they want to jeopardize that with stupid behavior and doing dumb things, then it’s their fault. Why should the NFL take a black eye for what individuals do?""

--Mike Ditka

""The only thing I'm proud about is the team I played for, they did the right thing. Take them off the field... Because you know what? As a man, that's the only thing we really respect. We don't respect no women. We don't respect no kids. The only thing Roger [Goodell] and them can do, take them off the field because they respect that.""

Carter's praising of the Vikings for heroically deactivating Peterson following his admission that he hit his child with a switch is a bit off, as the team had activated him to play that week. This was followed by intense public outcry and led to the Vikings then rescinding the activation a day and a half later. So yeah, they did the right thing, after enough people complained about them doing the very clearly wrong thing.

This is a lot of men who think a lot of things about these issues but they may not possess the eloquence needed to present their points. Although in somebody like Ditka's case, their points are wildly off base anyway. The best type of point we can hope for tonight is ""willful ignorance."" Why? Because, as Ben Collins writes in his Esquire piece:

""... ESPN has a $15.2 billion broadcasting agreement with the NFL. You will not hear these words because it would interfere with the amount of money both ESPN and the NFL can make.""

Mostly, though, the issue is this: On a panel choosing to discuss domestic abuse on the national stage, before an NFL football game, ESPN has filled out the roster with their extremely male water-carrying talking heads. And again, Ray freaking Lewis, who is no doubt being counted on for NFL Punishment Analysis and to discuss his long, hard journey back from being implicated in a double homicide to the unveiling of his statue in front of M&T Stadium. Their choice to talk about the issue is likely to be nothing more than further damage control, rather than an enlightening and frank discussion.

It will be very difficult to indicate that ESPN cares, and the NFL cares, and that you should care, if ESPN can't even take the issue seriously enough to find at the very least a female majority panel to discuss an issue that touches primarily women.

But it's okay, because Roger Goodell went to a domestic abuse call center, where he was very open about his plans to not forget about this issue as fast as he can.

""[Call center CEO Katie] Ray-Jones said Goodell did not discuss any specific policies the NFL might put in place for domestic violence.""

"286","A rumor on Tuesday claims Apple's upcoming Apple Watch will be priced at $500 for the mid-tier steel model and up to $5,000 for top-end gold ""Edition"" versions, a number much higher than previous estimates.

Citing an unnamed source, French website iGen reports Apple is looking to field the Apple Watch at a proposed retail cost of $500 for versions with stainless steel cases and between $4,000 and $5,000 for Apple Watch Edition models. This leaves the Apple Watch Sport version as Apple's lowest-priced option, which the company said would come in at $350.

While the website has been accurate in predicting recent Apple product launches, the claims are unverifiable and should be taken with a grain of salt.

Previous estimates from jewelers and industry analysts pegged high-end Apple Watch Edition models at $1,200. Edition versions are crafted from 18-karat gold, feature sapphire crystal and come with a variety of luxurious strap options. Apple has not commented on whether the entire chassis is solid gold, or merely gold plated, but the company apparently developed a variant of the metal twice as strong as the standard.

Additionally, the source claims Apple is still shooting for a launch on Valentine's Day.

Prior to the Apple Watch announcement, noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo accurately predicted that the device would come in two sizes and multiple models spread across a wide range of price points. At the time, he speculated the wearable could cost into the ""thousands of dollars.""

Apple announced its anticipated first foray into the wearables market in September, saying only that pricing would start at $350. Given that the Apple Watch Sport is made from relatively low-cost materials — aluminum, elastomer band and non-sapphire window — many believe it to be the entry-level model."
"288","Islamic State (IS) fighters may have captured weapons airdropped by the US near the Syrian town of Kobane, intended for the Kurdish forces defending it against the jihadists' onslaught. 

A video posted on YouTube on Tuesday by a group calling itself ""A3maq News"" purports to show airdropped supplies in the hands of the extremist group. The footage shows a masked and armed militant examining a package attached to a parachute. Later, he looks into crates containing various munitions, including RPG rounds and grenades. 

The video could not immediately be independently verified, but A3maq News has previously posted IS-linked content and the some of the weapons seen in the video appear to match those possessed by Iraq's Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), which supplied the arms.

The grenades seen at 1:28 in the video are reported to be German-made. Berlin sent 10,000 grenades to Iraqi Kurdistan in August as part of a consignment of military aid provided to the KRG's peshmerga fighters, according to publicly available German government documents. 

Additionally, US Central Command confirmed in a statement on Monday that one airdropped bundle had missed its target,. However, CentCom said it had been destroyed in a follow-up airstrike to stop it falling into enemy hands. 


American C-130 planes delivered weapons, ammunition and medical supplies provided by the KRG to People's Protection Units (YPG) fighters at dawn on Sunday, according to a CentCom statement. The operation was intended to ""enable continued resistance against ISIL's attempts to overtake Kobane,"" CentCom added, using the former name for the Islamic State.

YPG spokesperson Redur Xelil told Reuters that the weapons would ""help greatly"" in the fight against IS. ""The military assistance dropped by American planes at dawn on Kobane was good and we thank America for this support,"" he said.

Kobane is surrounded on three sides by IS and is bordered to the north by Turkey. The Turkish government has thus far refused repeated requests to open a land corridor allowing humanitarian and military supplies into the town, leading to accusations of tacit complicity in the IS assault on the Kurds, whose struggle for greater autonomy has long been a thorn in Ankara's side. However, on Monday it announced that it would allow Iraqi Kurdish fighters to cross the border to the town.

The airdrops were the first of their kind, but the US launched a series of airstrikes on IS targets in August, then extended operations into Syria in September. American planes have now carried out more than 135 airstrikes against IS in Kobane, according to the Centcom statement, which it says are indicated to have ""slowed ISIL [S] advances into the city, killed hundreds of their fighters and destroyed or damaged scores of pieces of ISIL combat equipment and fighting positions.""

"289","Finally, Pope Francis confirms what we've always known: All dogs go to heaven!
During his weekly address in St. Peter's Square, the Catholic leader tried to console a little boy who was heartbroken over the death of his beloved pup. According to multiple reports, Pope Francis told the boy, ""One day, we will see our animals again the eternity of Christ. Paradise is open to all of God's creatures.""
Of course, this viewpoint goes against the conservative Catholic ideology that because animals don't have souls (!), they can't go to heaven. Some theologians have cautioned, per the New York Times, that Pope Francis ""had spoken casually, not made a doctrinal statement.""

Others within the faith, however, took the pontiff's words for what they were. ""He said paradise is open to all creatures,"" Rev. James Martin, a Jesuit persist and editor at large of America, the Catholic Magazine, told the Times. ""That sounds pretty clear to me.""
It's pretty clear, too, that Pope Francis is a friend to the four-legged. In fact, he took his papal name from St. Francis of Assisi, the patron saint of animals.

"292","News of singer Axl Rose’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the December 2014 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, Guns N' Roses frontman is alive and well.

UPDATE 03/12/2014 : This story seems to be false. (read more)

Axl Rose death hoax spreads on Facebook

Rumors of the singer’s alleged demise gained traction on Monday after a ‘R.I.P. Axl Rose’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American singer’s passing:

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Monday (December 01, 2014), our beloved singer Axl Rose passed away. Axl Rose was born on February 6, 1962 in Lafayette. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”
Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 52-year-old singer, musician and songwriter was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.

Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a singer of Axl Rose's stature would be major news across networks.

A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (89%) of respondents think those Axl Rose death rumors are not funny anymore.

Axl Rose Death Hoax Dismissed Since Singer Is ‘Alive And Well’

On Tuesday (December 02) the singer's reps officially confirmed that Axl Rose is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.

Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved singer. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe."
"295","Led Zeppelin fans will be disappointed to learn that there’s no reunion tour and a story that appeared in the Daily Mirror suggesting that Robert Plant ripped up an $800 contract for such a gig is false, according to the Guardian.

The reported tour was supposedly financed by Virgin founder Richard Branson, who wanted to turn one of his Virgin planes into a new iteration of “The Starship,” the jet​ the band used to tour in the 1970s. The group was to play 35 dates in three locales-- London, Berlin and New Jersey.

Guitarist Jimmy Page and bassist John Paul Jones had signed on. And the late drummer John Bonham’s son Jason was to play drums for the band. “It was a no-brainer for them but Robert asked for 48 hours to think about it,” a source told the Daily Mirror. “When he said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given, there was an enormous sense of shock. There is no way they can go ahead without him.”

Turns out, the entire tale is “rubbish,” said Plant’s publicist to the Guardian, backing up what Page had said to the publication in September - a Zeppelin reunion was “[not] very likely.”"
"296","When Apple unveiled its Apple Watch, the company said the starting price would come in at US$349, but insider sources are claiming the stainless steel version will start at $500. Those sources also say the high-end gold Apple Watch Edition will start between $4,000 and $5,000, which is lower than many have been expecting.

Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500Apple's mid-range smartwatch will likely start at $500

Assuming the sources are correct, that pegs the anodized aluminum Apple Watch Sport as the lower-priced $349 model.

The anonymous sources, speaking with the French site iGen (English translation), also said Apple will ship its smartwatch in time for Valentine's Day in February. While a February release would be nice because it would get Apple Watch on consumer's wrists earlier, doesn't fit with Apple Senior Vice President of Retail Angela Ahrendts comments saying the smartwatch will ship in Spring 2015.

Apple Watch is a smartwatch device with sensors for tracking fitness activities and heart rate. It links to your iPhone to display alerts and messages, lets you reply to messages, shows turn-by-turn directions, learns your fitness routine and offers suggestions for improvement, and more. Three models in two sizes with multiple band options will be available when Apple Watch ships.

Hopefully Apple will release Apple Watch earlier in the year instead of some time in Spring, because even though products like Microsoft's new Band and Fitbit's just announced Surge aren't direct competitors, they are enticing enough to draw away some sales. Waiting until Spring could cost Apple some momentum, too.

iGen has been accurate in the past with Apple information, so they may be right on the pricing, but we're going with Angela Ahrendts on the release time frame because she's clearly in a good position to know when her own company's products will ship."
"298","Although Canadian police have not released the name of the Ottawa shooter, on Wednesday afternoon U.S. sources leaked that the suspect’s name is Michael Zehaf Bibeau, a 32-year-old Canadian who was a recent convert to Islam.

Mr. Bibeau’s name was first broadcast by CBS, allegedly via U.S. intelligence sources who had been in contact with their Canadian counterparts.

The suspect—who was reportedly born and raised in Quebec—has a lengthy criminal past in Montreal, Aylmer, QC and British Columbia.

A Zehaf-Bibeau resided in Montreal’s Villeray-Saint Michel-Park Extension borough between 2004 and 2006.

His most recent court record indicates Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau fell off the map for three years, as far as the Montreal courthouse was concerned, because he failed to show up in court on a simple marijuana charge that had been filed against him on March 14, 2006.

Parliament shooting

He turned up in court more than three years later, on Dec. 12, 2009, to plead guilty to the charge. As part of his sentence he was granted an absolute discharge. (Under that charge the man was charged and convicted under the name Michael Bibeau-Zehaf.)

His most serious conviction came on Dec. 7, 2004, when Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau pleaded guilty to possession of phencyclidine, also known as PCP, and was sentenced to a 60-day prison term.

On the same day, he also pleaded guilty to marijuana possession and was sentenced to one day in prison. He has also been convicted for failing to comply with conditions of a release.

In court records related to another charge for breach of conditions, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau listed his address as being in Aylmer, QC, a city of 40,000 just 23 minutes west of Downtown Ottawa.

And, just two years ago, Mr. Bibeau was on the West Coast.




According to British Columbia Court records, a “Michael Joseph Paul Zehaf Bibeau” committed robbery in Vancouver on December 16, 2011, and also racked up a lesser charge of uttering threats.

As of Tuesday evening, Vancouver Police were working with Ottawa law enforcement to pass on information about the suspect’s time in B.C.

“The Vancouver Police Department, along with the BC RCMP, are working together to assist an Ottawa City Police and RCMP National Security investigation,” wrote Vancouver Police spokesman Randy Fincham late Wednesday afternoon. “Due to the ongoing investigation, there is little information we can share at this time,” he added.

Citing confidential sources, the Globe and Mail reported Tuesday that Mr. Bibeau was a “high-risk traveller” whose passport had been seized to prevent him from travelling abroad to join ISIS fighters in Iraq or Syria.

On Tuesday, the RCMP confirmed that Martin Rouleau, the man accused of running over two Canadian Forces soldiers in Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu, had been one of 90 suspects under similar observation.

Nevertheless, as of Tuesday the RCMP had not confirmed that they had been monitoring Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau.

Unlike other Canadian homegrown terrorist suspects, Mr. Zehaf-Bibeau had no obvious web presence: No Twitter account, no Facebook page, and no Jihadist scrawls in random blogs or YouTube comment sections.

Witnesses say they saw Bibeau wearing a black coat with blue jeans, according to the CBC. The same report says gun used in the attack was a double-barrel shotgun.

Although, if the example of Saint-Jean-Sur-Richelieu terrorist suspect Martin Rouleau is any indication, he may have changed his name following his conversion to Islam.

Before he allegedly ran over two Canadian soldiers in the parking lot of a Service Canada location, Mr. Rouleau reportedly changed his name to Ahmad LeConverti (Ahmad The Converted).

Although there are no Zehafs listed in Canadian phone books, the name Bibeau is common throughout Quebec.

On Wednesday, Quebecer Michaël Bideau noted on his Facebook page that he shared virtually the same name and birth year of the alleged shooter.

The image, which was apparently snapped from a TV screen using a cell phone, showed a dark-haired man wearing a scarf and holding a light hunting rifle.

Witness accounts from the scene say that the shooter was armed with a double-barreled shotgun.

According to reports from Ottawa Police, however, the shooter was armed with a 30-30 rifle, a caliber common to lever-action hunting rifles that would be consistent with the firearm held by the man featured in the Tweeted image.

The image remains unconfirmed, however, and Twitter suspended the account shortly before 5 p.m. ET."
"299","Young boy is seen holding guns in images circulated on social media

Isis supporters are circulating images of a child they say has become the youngest foreign fighter to be killed in battle for the jihadist group, according a counter-extremism think tank.

The images, which cannot be independently verified, show a young boy believed to be about 10-years-old holding guns, posing with a balaclava stretched across his face and standing alongside a man thought to be his father who is reportedly a militant.

Those sharing the pictures are paying tribute to the child on Twitter as the youngest martyr from the Arabian Peninsula to have been killed in Syria as Isis tries to establish a caliphate across swathes of the region, according to Charlie Cooper, a researcher at the Quilliam Foundation.

Mr Cooper said the images have been circulated on social media with hashtags translated as ‘martyrdom of the cub of Baghdadi and his father'. It is claimed that reports of his death first emerged on 26 September and that he was killed fighting alongside his father.

The child’s alleged death comes after an Australian man fighting for Isis posted a picture online showing his young son holding the severed head of a Syrian soldier in August, with the caption: ""That’s my boy.""

In the same month, a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council found Isis affiliated groups have recruited, trained and used children in active combat roles.

It also found Isis has established training camps to recruit children into armed roles, where they would receive weapons training and religious education. In Raqqa, children as young as ten were being recruited and trained by Isis.

The UN said: “In using children below the age of 15, the group has committed a war crime.”

News of the boy’s alleged death comes as video footage was released showing Isis firing on targets on the besieged Syria-Turkey border town of Kobani.

The video has been distributed by the pro-Isis media group Al-A’amaq, who publish clips showing the strategic assets seized by the group and where it is advancing.

In it, the fighters can be heard vowing to descend on the town in spite of coalition air strikes, with one warning: “We will enter the city and free it from non-believers.”"
"300","Apple took the leap into the wearable space with the announcement of its Apple Watch earlier in September this year, revealing that the device will start at $349. Now rumors suggest that the gold and stainless steel editions of the Apple Watch may set consumers back by $5,000 and $500, respectively!

Apple revealed that it would release three collections - Sport Collection, Watch Collection and Edition Collection, which would be composed of aluminum, stainless steel and gold cases, respectively. It was anticipated that the company would have three basic price points, which would vary depending on the band choice and perhaps size.

Now, according to French website iGen.fr, the stainless steel version of the Apple Watch will start at $500, whereas the gold variant of the wearable may start from $4000 to $5000.

""Apple Watch Stainless Steel (polished or black sidereal) would be proposed at $ 500. The Edition model in yellow or pink gold would be sold between $4,000 and $ 5,000 (translated),"" reveals iGen.fr.

The French website cites reliable sources as the basis of its information. iGen.fr has a track record of being dependable as the publication reported the dimensions of the then impending iPhone 6 Plus and iPhone 6 smartphones from Apple correctly.

Previous estimates from industry experts have pegged the top-end gold Apple Watch's pricing between $1000 and $5000. The Edition Collection will be fashioned from 18K gold and have sapphire crystal. This variant of the Apple Watch will also come with several expensive strap options. Apple, however, has not disclosed whether the chassis of this variant of the Apple Watch is solid gold or simply gold plated.


According to iGen.fr's sources, the Apple Watch will release by Feb. 2015 on Valentine's Day. Both resellers and distributors are fervently preparing for the mid-Feb release of the Apple Watch next year per the site.

Apple SVP of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts' leaked video to employees let slip that the company would release the Apple Watch in Spring next year.

With the pricing of the stainless steel and gold variants of the Apple Watch veering towards the expensive, it seems the aluminum version is poised to be the low-end model. It will be interesting to see if consumers are willing to spend a bomb on a smartwatch whose performance is not known."

This year, whether it meant to or not, it may have some big news: 9to5Mac has some new details that say there's a 12-inch MacBook Air with a completely new design, a higher-resolution display, and few of the trappings we've come to expect from a MacBook Air.

Here's Mark Gurman at 9to5Mac:

Apple is preparing an all-new MacBook Air for 2015 with a radically new design that jettisons standards such as full-sized USB ports, MagSafe connectors, and SD card slots in favor of a markedly thinner and lighter body with a higher-resolution display. Sources within Apple, who have used internal prototype versions of the upcoming computer, have provided in-depth details about the machine, and our exclusive artist renditions of the revamped MacBook Air provide the first close look at Apple’s first major step in mobile Mac computing since the Retina MacBook Pro launch in 2012.
According to Gurman's sources, there are a number of other changes as well. The function keys and arrow keys have been redesigned, and the keyboard sits completely edge to edge on the palmrest. It's smaller and narrower, apparently, and the trackpad doesn't have the same clicking feedback. Of course, let's be clear: these are leaks and sources, who are often working with incomplete and occasionally incorrect information. Things also change, a lot, between leaks and release. But also, Mark Gurman has a long history of being right.

These photos, too, are not real. They are renderings, guesses as to what the Macbook might be. But if these sources are right, confirming rumors we've been hearing for months and years — of a lighter, thinner, higher-res MacBook Air — 2015 could be a big year for Apple's laptops."

New spaces will be added to Apple Stores specifically for this purpose, according to the report, which refers to this as a new ""shopping option.""

Salespeople are being trained to help customers pick out specific models.

When it first presented the watch in September, it stressed that the Apple Watch is meant to tell the time before anything else.

It's the first new product category Apple has unveiled since the introduction of the iPad in 2010, and the company's retail strategy will also be telling of how Angel Ahrendts, Apple's new senior vice president of retail, is handling the job.

"308","Nigeria said on Friday it had agreed a ceasefire with Islamist militants Boko Haram and reached a deal for the release of more than 200 schoolgirls kidnapped by the group six months ago.

There was no immediate confirmation from the rebels, who have brought five years of havoc in Africa’s top oil producer and triggered an international outcry by seizing the girls from the northeast town of Chibok in April.

“I wish to inform this audience that a ceasefire agreement has been concluded,” said the head of Nigeria’s military, Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh, adding the deal had followed three days of talks with the militant sect.

Government spokesman Mike Omeri said the deal covered the release of the captives and Boko Haram had given assurances “that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well.”

Their release would be a huge boost for President Goodluck Jonathan, who faces an election next year and has been pilloried at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping and his inability to quell the violence, the biggest security threat to Africa’s biggest economy.

Apart from one appearance on a Boko Haram video, the girls have not been seen since the brazen nighttime raid on the town near the Cameroon border, although police and a parent said last month that one of the victims had been released.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates as “Western education is sinful,” has killed thousands of people in its fight to create an Islamic caliphate in the vast scrubland of Nigeria’s impoverished northeast.

A senior Nigerian security source confirmed the existence of talks, but said it remained unclear whether Abuja was negotiating with self-proclaimed movement leader Abubakar Shekau, or another faction within the group.

“Commitment among parts of Boko Haram and the military does appear to be genuine. It is worth taking seriously,” the security source told Reuters.

Several rounds of negotiations have been attempted in recent years but they have never achieved a peace deal, partly because the group is believed to be deeply divided.

“There are some talks but it depends on the buy-in of the whole group. I would be surprised if Shekau had suddenly changed his mind and is ready for a ceasefire,” the source added.

The government was negotiating with Danladi Ahmadu, a man calling himself the secretary-general of Boko Haram, a presidency source said. It was not clear if Ahmadu is part of the same faction as Shekau.

Security sources in neighbouring Chad said Chadian mediators had been involved in the discussions, which were part of a larger deal that led to the release a week ago of 27 hostages, including 10 Chinese workers, kidnapped in Cameroon.

Separately, Cameroon’s defence ministry said eight soldiers and 107 Boko Haram militants had been killed in fighting in the far north on Wednesday and Thursday, a region that has suffered regular cross-border raids."
"311","Islamic State insurgents released a video on Tuesday purportedly showing the beheading of U.S. journalist James Foley, who had gone missing in Syria nearly two years ago, and images of another American journalist whose life they said depended on U.S. action in Iraq.

The video, titled “A Message To America,” was posted on social-media websites. It was not immediately possible to verify its authenticity.

Mr. Foley, who has reported in the Middle East for five years, was kidnapped on Nov. 22, 2012, by unidentified gunmen. Steven Sotloff, who appeared at the end of the video, went missing in northern Syria while he was reporting in July, 2013.

A Twitter account set up by Mr. Foley’s family to help find him said early on Wednesday: “We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.”

The White House said that U.S. intelligence agents were working to verify the authenticity of the video.

Islamic State, an al-Qaeda offshoot, had not previously executed American citizens publicly. The Sunni militant group has declared a caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria in areas it controls.

The video, which was posted after the United States resumed air strikes in Iraq for the first time since the end of the U.S. occupation in 2011, opened with a clip of U.S. President Barack Obama saying he had authorized strikes in Iraq.

“Obama authorizes military operations against the Islamic State effectively placing America upon a slippery slope toward a new war front against Muslims,” words appear in English and Arabic on the screen.

It showed black-and-white aerial footage of air strikes with text saying “American aggression against the Islamic State”

A person identified as James Foley and wearing an orange outfit is seen kneeling in the desert as a man in black dress with a black mask stands beside him, holding a knife.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacency and criminality,” the kneeling man says.

The man in the mask speaks in a British accent and says: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen, of your country. As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression toward the Islamic State.

“Today your military air force is attacking us daily in Iraq. Your strikes have caused casualties amongst Muslims. You are no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide.”

Following his statement, he beheads the kneeling man.

At the end of the video, words on the side of the screen say “Steven Joel Sotloff” as another prisoner in an orange jumpsuit is shown on screen.

“The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the masked man says.

Mr. Foley, a freelance reporter, had been covering Syria’s civil war for GlobalPost. In 2011, he was held for 45 days by forces loyal to former Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

Mr. Sotloff is also a freelancer journalist with published stories in Time Magazine and Foreign Policy. He has worked in Syria, Libya and Yemen.

Islamic State has executed hundreds of people in Syria and Iraq during its advance. Its members follow a hard-line interpretation of Sunni Islam but target all those who oppose it, including Sunni Muslims.

The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group, said Islamic State militants had executed 700 members of a Sunni tribe in eastern Syria in two weeks, the majority of them civilians.

“We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL,” White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said, referring to the militant group by an earlier name, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant.

“If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist, and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends.”

Islamic State also released another video on Tuesday that gave the strongest indication yet it might attempt to strike American targets.

The video with the theme “breaking of the American cross” boasts Islamic State will emerge victorious over “crusader” America.

It follows a video posted on Monday, warning of attacks on American targets if Washington struck against its fighters in Iraq and Syria.

The latest footage spoke of a holy war between Islamic State and the United States, which occupied Iraq for nearly a decade and faced stiff resistance from al-Qaeda.

Unlike al-Qaeda, Islamic State has so far focused on territorial gains designed to eventually establish a full-blown Islamist empire."

"322","LOS ANGELES, California ( The Adobo Chronicles) – He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night’s Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award. West popped up on stage and moved toward Beck as if he was about to take the trophy from him. Instead, West turned away and quickly jumped down.

Beck beat out both the night’s top winner, Sam Smith, and the category’s expected winner, Beyoncé.

The incident was a repeat of the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards, when West accosted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech after Swift’s “You Belong With Me” beat Beyoncé’s “Single Ladies” for Female Video of the Year.

“Yo, Taylor, I’m really happy for you, I’ma let you finish,” West said after taking the microphone at Radio City Music Hall, “but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time! One of the best videos of all time!”

West was roundly criticized for his action and was even called a “jackass” by no less than President Obama.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People’s Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the ‘West boycott.’

No more Kanye West on live TV! And Beyoncé just lost her most loyal cheerleader."
"323","NORTH HOLLYWOOD, California -

Kurt Sutter, creator of the hit FX drama Sons of Anarchy, has announced plans to turn the popular television series into a major motion picture.

Sutter, who was also a writer, producer, and director on the series, said in an interview with Hollywood Today magazine that he has long contemplated taking S.O.A. to the big screen following its run on television. “People absolutely loved the show, as did I, and I have put a lot of thought into the matter, and we are going forward with turning it into a feature film” Sutter said.

Sons of Anarchy ran for seven seasons on FX, from 2008-2014, and in the process built a huge following. Sutter said the film will star Charlie Hunnam, who played the lead character Jax Teller, as well as Ryan Hurst who played Opie Winston, and Katey Sagal as Gemma Teller. The film, which is a prequel to the storyline of Sons will also introduce fans to Jax’s father, John, who will be played by Brad Pitt.

“I am most excited about bringing Brad (Pitt) on as John Teller, he is absolutely perfect for the role. The movie will take place from the day Jax was born, and leads up to the era just before Sons Of Anarchy began as a series.”

Sutter also said that he is really happy to bring Ryan Hurst back as Opie Winston, and hopes fans will forgive him for killing Opie off. “Man I tell ya, when we killed Opie off, it was like the thing turned real. I’ve never gone public with this, but I’ve had people get really crazy when they see me in public,” said Sutter. “They shout at me, and they get angry - ‘You shouldn’t have killed Ope! I hope you rot in Hell!,’ that sort of thing. I had people try to run me off the road when they recognized me, although that just might be because I’m kind of a dangerous driver. Anyway, my hope is that this film will help them cope.”

Sutter says pre-production on film will begin in the middle of 2015, and will begin shooting sometime in the fall. “For a movie of this scope, with this much storyline attached, you should expect to see the film by the end of 2016,” said Sutter. “In the mean time, buy all the official Sons of Anarchy merchandise you can. Every dollar goes to helping get this movie completed. Brad Pitt isn’t cheap, you know.”"
"324","Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson is pushing back against a claim made by Rep. Duncan Hunter that at least 10 Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant fighters were apprehended trying to come into the U.S. from Mexico.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said of ISIL insurgents illegally entering the country from along the southern border on CNN Wednesday evening. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

The top DHS official didn’t mention Hunter, a California Republican congressman, by name. But on several occasions, Johnson said that public officials have a “responsibility” to not “unnecessarily frighten the American public.”

“Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” the secretary told host Wolf Blitzer.

Blitzer asked specifically about comments made Tuesday evening by Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee. “[A]t least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” the congressman said during an interview on Fox News, citing information from source from Customs and Border Protection, which is under DHS authority. Hunter also suggested that it was likely that “dozens” of others linked to the terrorist group that has recently beheaded two American journalists and two British aid workers would likely not get caught by border agents and make their way into the U.S.

On Wednesday, DHS flatly said that Hunter’s claim was unfounded. “The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesperson said.

Judicial Watch reported later Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border in 36 hours.

Hunter’s deputy chief of staff, Joe Kasper, told POLITICO that the congressman stands by his statement, which came from a conversation with a “high-level” source, but didn’t elaborate when asked about the individuals’ specific ties to ISIL.

In September, Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah claimed that four men linked to terrorist organizations tried to cross the border earlier that month."
"330","British intelligence agencies MI5 and MI6 have identified the man suspected of the horrific beheading of American journalist James Foley, according to British media reports.

The hooded man with an English accent is believed to be 23-year-old Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, known to fellow Islamic State militants as Jihadi John.

Key suspect: Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary who raps under the name Lyricist Jinn. Photo: YouTube

The former rapper left his family home in an affluent west London suburb last year to fight in the civil war in Syria.

In early August he tweeted a photo of himself wearing military camouflage and a black hood, while holding a severed head in his left hand.

British SAS forces are hunting Foley's killer, using a range of high-tech equipment to track him down and potentially free other hostages.

Murdered: American journalist James Foley. Photo: AP

The Mail on Sunday is reporting that a ""significant force"" of SAS personnel has been deployed to northern Iraq over the past two days, joining local units fighting the Islamic State. They have fanned out into four-man teams, accompanying Iraqi and Kurdish troops in an effort to find British jihadists.

The Sunday Times reports that Bary is the key focus of the manhunt. He is one of the British jihadists referred to by former hostages as the Beatles because of their British accents. The two others were called ""George"" and ""Ringo"".

The two other Britons suspected of involvement in the crime are Aine Davis, a former drug dealer who converted to Islam, and Razul Islam, who is believed to have joined the terrorist group that murdered Foley.

Bary is the son of an Egyptian-born militant who is awaiting trial on terrorism charges in Manhattan, due to his alleged involvement in the bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998.

Before leaving the family home to fight in Syria, Bary was an aspiring rapper known as L Jinny whose music was played on one of Britain's most popular radio stations, BBC Radio 1.

&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;

Recordings of his songs will prove vital to the investigating team, with experts using voice recognition technology to match his voice with that of the man who brutally decapitated Mr Foley.

Bary made a number of music videos for his songs, with titles such as Flying High, Dreamer and Overdose.

It is believed he was indoctrinated by an Islamic preacher named Anjem Choudary who persuaded him to join the fight in Syria."

"337","A propaganda video claiming to show U.S. journalist James Wright Foley kneeling on a mountaintop and making a long anti-U.S. statement, presumably under duress, was posted to YouTube on Tuesday. Foley is standing next to an ISIS militant, who makes some remarks placing the blame for Foley’s death on U.S. President Barack Obama, before appearing to behead Foley with a knife.

The video, posted by Furqan Media, an official ISIS outlet, begins with footage of President Obama’s speech announcing his authorization of air strikes against ISIS in northern Iraq, preceded by these words: “Obama authorizes military operation against the Islamic State, effectively placing America upon a slippery slope towards a new war front against Muslims.” The video, which gives no hint as to where Foley was being held, then shows footage of the recent air strike in northern Iraq, before cutting to the beginning of Foley’s speech.

In the statement, during which he remained calm, Foley appeared to date his remarks by referring to recent strikes in Iraq. He specifically mentioned his brother John, a member of the U.S. Air Force.

The militant at Foley’s side started his speech by saying: “This is James Wright Foley, an American citizen of your country.” His statement referred to the recent air strikes, and continued: “You’re no longer fighting an insurgency. We are an Islamic army, and a state that has been accepted by a large number of Muslims worldwide, so effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic caliphate as their leadership.”

Time magazine journalist Steven Sotloff, who has also been missing in Syria since August 2013, was paraded alive toward the end of the video, with the ISIS militant holding him threatening the U.S. president, saying that Sotloff’s life depended on Obama’s next move in Iraq.

Foley, a freelance journalist working for the Global Post, went missing near Taftanaz in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012, as he was on his way out of the country. His family and fellow journalists have been campaigning for his release ever since. Foley also spent six weeks in captivity in Libya while reporting on the war there in 2011. Numerous theories were posited for his disappearance, with many surmising that he was no longer alive, or that he was in Syrian state custody.

Jihadist forums immediately lit up with gloating posts upon the video’s publication, with exhortations to keep pushing the propaganda via social media. Said one, posting on the Hanein forums: “We must upload the video with a title in both Arabic and English for it to arrive to the American people … Keep uploading the video every minute since YouTube declared war on us you brothers.” Journalists and others, meanwhile, urged people not to share the video.

The original video was immediately removed from YouTube for breaching its terms and conditions on violent content, but multiple copies are continuing to pop up.

Several others pounced on the fact that Foley was shown in military-style fatigues during a split-screen portion of the video. “Look at minute 2:16, is he a soldier or a journalist!!” said one."

"343","A small furor has erupted over whether a Saudi television station blurred out the image of U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in the broadcast of her and President Barack Obama’s meeting with new Saudi King Salman today in Riyadh. Saudi officials deny the claim.

The new king shook hands with President Obama at the Erga Palace but didn’t acknowledge the first lady during a brief meeting at the funeral for King Abdullah. Barack and Michelle Obama cut short their trip to India to attend the funeral.  

Several videos posted on Saudis' Facebook pages obscured Michelle Obama's face. They were removed shortly after they were posted. I captured a screenshot of one such video before it was taken down. The Arab news service Mashahead posted on YouTube a video allegedly taken from the Saudi government television broadcast showing the blurred spot.

However,  Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, e-mailed me that ""Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred."" CNN's Hala Gorani tweeted that her colleague Nic Robertson, in Riyadh, saw non-blurred images on Saudi TV. Other news organizations, such as Al Jazeera, showed the meeting without obscuring Michelle Obama’s face.


 

The alleged blurring wasn't the only controversy.  Some Arab media outlets criticized Michelle Obama for wearing a blue dress, rather than a black one. Videos of the short meeting between Salman and President Obama showed the king leaving in the middle of the protocol, abruptly turning around and walking away, in order to go to prayer.

After the meeting, Barack Obama and Salman held a bilateral meeting that included Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal and CIA director John Brennan.

According to the White House pool report, “Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”

Obama praised the late king in a statement following his death, saying “King Abdullah's vision was dedicated to the education of his people and to greater engagement with the world.” In an interview with CNN before the visit, Obama explained why he was hesitant to press the new king about Saudi Arabia’s human rights record, which includes restricting the rights of women.

""Sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability,"" Obama said.

"344","While child entrepreneurs have become increasingly common in the last decade, not many hit the lofty heights that 17-year-old “teen wolf” Mohammed Islam reached when his trading earnings reached the “high eight figures.”

As the New York Post reports, Islam, a teenager from Queens, still lives at home with his parents, but has been trading on the stock exchange on his lunch breaks at Stuyvesant High School. The Teen Wolf is the son of immigrants from Bengal in South Asia. Mohammed trades with two other friends, and they hope to start a hedge fund when the Teen Wolf turns 18 and graduates from high school.

Islam started with penny stocks at the unbelievable age of 9. When most kids are in the fourth grade, they’re learning to play sports, and figuring out fractions. Mohammed was putting his tutoring earnings to work. As often happens on the stock exchange, Islam lost his initial investment. He describes the event as “paralyzing,” and swore off the market thinking he just didn’t have the required nerves of steel.

Bengal region of Asia

Perhaps to better understand the losses that crippled him, Islam turned to studying modern finance, and became enthralled with Paul Tudor Jones. Jones is a billionaire from Connecticut who manages hedge funds and private assets. As is often the case, much of Jones’ success came on the heels of failure. Thousands and thousands of dollars lost, over and over, but Jones kept coming back for more, and ultimately captured overwhelming success. That fortitude, paired with his positive outlook, inspired Mohammed to give the game another try. And like the man who inspired him, Mohammed Islam has become a resounding success in his own right.

The Teen Wolf moniker is a reference to Leonardo DiCaprio’s portrayal of Jordan Belfort — called the “wolf of Wall Street,” another young trader who had an uncanny ability to make money on the stock exchanges. Islam and his trading buddies intend to become billionaires by next year.

“What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don’t keep going there’s no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.”

But according to Mohammed Islam and his friends, it’s not just about the money.

“We want to create a brotherhood. Like, all of us who are connected, who are in something together, who have influence.”

The Post reported that despite his resounding success, Islam is shy and modest, and only gave a rough estimate of his earnings. While he has a very bright future, and grand dreams for his journey into it, for now he has to content himself with expensive meals at Morimoto (an upscale Japanese restaurant), a high end BMW that he has no license to drive, and a swanky Manhattan apartment that he’s not old enough to move into.

The real “Wolf of Wall Street” wasn’t exactly role model material, and as the Inquisitr pointed out, even the movie was beleaguered in controversy and monetary fraud. Hopefully the catchy nickname “Teen Wolf” can be re-imaged by the smart and tenacious teen from New York City."
"345","UTAH COUNTY — Over the years, holiday office Christmas parties have gained a reputation for crazy antics. Often, there's a lot of heavy drinking. One overly zealous drinker in Utah County nearly killed himself a couple of weeks ago, winding up in the hospital for three days.

Even though the drinks at the party contained no alcohol, a heavy drink nearly put Ryan Roche out of commission for the holidays.

""I think it was one of those spur of the moment kind of things,"" Roche said.

As his holiday office party wound down earlier this month, Roche headed for the door with his wife and kids.

""They busted out some eggnog.""

An eggnog-chugging contest was getting started, and one of Roche's colleagues called him out to compete. Roche said he's a competitive guy and couldn't walk away.

""I've already decided, if I'm going to do it, I'm going to win,"" he said.

The record at that point was 22 seconds. There was a Ruth's Chris Steak House gift card on the line, so Roche faced off against two other co-workers.

""I just opened up my throat, didn't even swallow,"" he said. ""I pretty much poured it down.""

I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably. I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.
–Ryan Roche
As the video shows, he drank a quart of eggnog in just 12 seconds, without taking a breath.

""I got done, and I was gasping, I couldn't breathe.""

Roche said he was coughing a lot as he headed home, but thought he would be OK. A couple of hours later, he wasn't so sure.

""I was pretty much shaking uncontrollably,"" he said. ""I was shaking so badly, I was nauseous, and my breathing became a pant.""

He asked a friend in medical school to come over to his house and check on him. The friend took him to the hospital.

Roche had aspirated the eggnog to his lungs and was essentially ""dry drowning,"" the doctors told him.

""They pretty much had to wheelchair me in, double IV, oxygen, and hooked me up to what they call the nuclear weapon of antibiotics,"" he said.

The liquid in his lungs was starting an infection. He spent 24 hours in intensive care with a fever, sweats and chills.

""It was rough,"" he said. ""Eggnog: not ideal for the lungs.""

On day three in the hospital, doctors took him off oxygen, and he went home. After about a week, he was back at full strength.

It was a holiday mishap he'll never forget, and also probably never live down. Roche did win, but at quite a price.

""Not only do I get a Ruth's Chris gift card, but I got a three night's stay in the hospital."""

"348","One of the best things about the Internet is the speed at which it allows information to be shared. Unfortunately, this means all information -- even false ones like the news about the six-day darkness that would envelop the world in December.

The report ""NASA Confirms Earth Will Experience 6 Days of Total Darkness in December 2014"" was published by Huzlers.com. Considering the site labeled itself as offering ""a combination of real shocking news and satirical entertainment to keep its visitors in a state of disbelief,"" the story should have been taken with a grain of salt at the very least.

According to the story, NASA ""confirmed"" that the Earth would be experiencing six days of nearly complete darkness from Dec. 16 to 22. The event would supposedly happen because of a solar storm that would spur enough dust and debris in space that 90 percent of sunlight would be blocked out.

NASA head Charles Bolden was said to have made the announcement, asking people to remain calm given a solar storm so bad (the biggest in 250 years!) was going to happen that it would block out the sun for 216 hours.

Reporters also apparently ""interviewed"" people to hear what they had to say about the event, with Michael Hearns responding with a ""We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam.""

How people took that response seriously is a mystery.

Six days of darkness, if it were to really happen, sounds like a big deal but the story downplays it in the end, noting that officials said that major problems would not arise anyway. A certain Earl Godoy, a NASA scientist, reiterated there would be no problem because the planet could survive on ""artificial light"" during the event.

NASA has not made any official statements regarding this six-day period of darkness descending on Earth.

The good news is that this means the world will not be falling into darkness for six days in December. The bad news is that people aren't very good at separating what's real from what's not, liking and sharing the story thousands of times since it first came out on Oct. 25.

Huzlers.com was also responsible for reports in the past where Tupac Shakur claimed he was alive, Ebola victims rose from the dead, and Floyd Mayweather offered a $1 million annual salary to have someone read everything for him."

While neither Chastain nor Rogen have deals in place, the latter actor is in talks to play Wozniak, who created the Apple I computer and co-created the Apple II computer in the mid-1970s.

Scott Rudin, Mark Gordon and Guymon Casady are producing the film, which Sony has high hopes for, as it could be a major awards contender.

Rogen has proved himself more than capable of handling dramatic roles with his performances in “Take This Waltz” and “50/50.” Rogen's potential pairing with Bale has been compared to Martin Scorsese's decision to cast Jonah Hill alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in “The Wolf of Wall Street,” which of course culminated with the actor's second Oscar nomination.

Rogen next stars opposite James Franco in “The Interview,” which Sony will release on Christmas Day. Rogen and producing partner Evan Goldberg co-directed the R-rated comedy, just as they did Sony's upcoming animated movie “Sausage Party.” Rogen recently wrapped Sony's untitled Christmas Eve movie, which reteams him with his “50/50” collaborators Joseph Gordon-Levitt and director Jonathan Levine.

Rogen is represented by UTA, Principal Entertainment LA and attorney Fred Toczek.

Chastain, who is simply being courted for an unspecified role and does not have a deal in place, previously starred in Sony's “Zero Dark Thirty” and is known to have a close relationship with studio chief Amy Pascal. She next stars in Christopher Nolan's “Interstellar” and will soon be seen opposite Oscar Isaac in “A Most Violent Year.” She's represented by CAA and Mosaic."
"350","If the past few weeks of nonstop media onslaught about North Korea and The Interview just haven’t quite appeased your insatiable appetite for Kim Jong-Un antics, fear not—there are other things (literally) cooking up his tunic sleeves.

Everyone’s favorite guilty pleasure, the sometimes-reliable, sometimes-not UK rag The Daily Mail, reports that the dictator is eyeing Scotland as the location for his next business venture—an expansion of the restaurant chain known as Pyongyang, which is owned by the North Korean government and used to generate additional cash flow overseas. There are currently franchises in cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Kuala Lampur, Jakarta, and more recently, Amsterdam.

Although the proposed new location may seem a bit random, Scotland has allegedly been singled out for two reasons. The first is that Kim Jong-Un and other elite North Korean officials love drinking Scotch whisky. (His father, the late Kim Jong-Il, was a bigger fan of Hennessy, supposedly spending some £700,000 a year on the cognac.)

In September of this year when the United Kingdom debated whether or not Scotland should be granted sovereignty, Kim Jong-Un was allegedly a supporter of the country’s independence because—as Choe Kwan-il, managing editor of North Korean paper Choson Sinbo, told UK’s Daily Mirror—“North Korea is rich in natural resources and we like the taste of Scotch whisky, so [Scotland and North Korea] can be beneficial to each other.”

In terms of the potential new addition to the Pyongyang chain, The Daily Mail claims that the other reason why North Korea might single out Scotland is that they want to make nice with some European countries in hopes of improving diplomacy and their global image. North Korean Leadership Watch editor Michael Madden tells the Mail that Kim Jong-Un has been trying to think of ways to buddy up with Scotland ever since its bid for sovereignty, and has more hope for acceptance there than in those other judgy European countries like England and France. Madden also claims that tourists in North Korea are already encouraged to pay tips in Scotch rather than won (the local currency).

Jenny Town of the US-Korea Institute is also quoted as arguing, “North Korea is going to support any country struggling for independence and legitimacy, as North Korea itself still continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy as a sovereign nation.” In this case, that may mean trying to snuggle up with a Pyongyang franchise that will attempt to win over the Scots via dishes such as barbecued cuttlefish, kimchi, pine-nut gruel, dog meat soup, and a mysterious aphrodisiac made out of bears. (Although these foods are served at other Pyongyang restaurants, there is no specific evidence that they’d make their way onto menus in Scotland).

There has been no official announcement from North Korea confirming that they are opening a restaurant in Scotland—in fact, a Korean embassy official recently denied the story to The Independent. But as it is with many other wealth-generating businesses in North Korea, many critics believe that cash flow from the restaurant chain goes straight to Jong-Un himself and his small group of elites with virtually no trickle-down to the North Korean people.

Kim Jong-Un, 31, gained quite a bit of attention earlier this year for his diagnosis of gout, a disease commonly caused by overindulgence in rich, fatty foods. It was widely reported that he became ill and developed a limp and facial swelling because he had become literally addicted to Emmental, more commonly called “Swiss cheese.”

No other details about the new restaurant have yet to be verified, so it’s unclear whether tipping in whisky would be encouraged."
"352","A former American soldier from Wisconsin who has become the face of the YPG Kurdish military force in Syria, told UPI Wednesday in an exclusive interview that civilians have been burned in an Islamic State attack, with injuries consistent with chemical weapons.

Jordan Matson, 28, a former U.S. Army soldier speaking from Derik, Syria, said his information comes from Walat Omar, the head field doctor in the embattled border town of Kobane, which is encircled by IS militants. Matson and others in the area said the injuries were caused by chemical weapons.

""Since I got the phone calls here in the location... I looked into it myself and after I'd seen pictures from fighters... from Kobane, I contacted the local field doctor on the ground in Kobane and he had sent me many pictures from the hospital,"" Matson said in his first video interview with U.S. media.

""We're trying to get a video camera to Kobane because they don't have one right now to record the injured and show the world proof of what's going on over there. ... We're making more attempts to have more solidified proof for the rest of the world.""

Omar posted photos to Facebook of visible burns that were reportedly sustained in the overnight attack.

Matson, a native of Sturtevant, Wisconsin, arrived in Syria last month via Iraq and quickly became the public face of the YPG.

""Someone had to do it,"" he said, laughing.

He is more serious in the widely publicized image of him clad in camouflage, a head scarf and carrying a weapon now appearing across YPG's social media accounts. Although the public role ""was thrown on me,"" Matson is quick to add he's happy to play it because the media attention has ""brought light to the situation here.""

Matson says American veterans are ""outraged"" over the deteriorating security situation in Iraq.

""We do not want to see our brothers' lives be for nothing,"" he said. ""So, in the hundreds, veterans are lining up to come over here because if our government won't do anything, we will.""

Matson acknowledged that the recent U.S. airdrops of Iraqi-provided weapons to YPG fighters in Kobane are helpful in the battle against IS, but that more is needed.

On Tuesday, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was asked to explain U.S. support to non-vetted local fighters in Syria.

Earnest said that while there is ""limited insight into those particular fighters... the fact is, at this point, they are working hard to defeat ISIL forces that right now are concentrated on this specific community.""

""So we're going to evaluate each of these circumstances as they come along to look for opportunities to support local fighters against ISIL,"" Earnest said.

Matson said YPG needs more weapons and night vision goggles. The Islamic State militants, he said, fight primarily under cover of darkness and engage with YPG within 300 meters.

Night vision goggles ""would give us the ability to see them coming, organize our defenses and engage the enemy, and force ISIS to fight us at day because we would have a larger advantage.""

On Tuesday, the YPG launched a recruitment campaign. ""JOIN People's Defense Units/YPG/in Rojava, Syria, SEND TERRORISTS TO HELL and SAVE HUMANITY,"" reads the YPG's 'Lions of Rojava' recruitment message.

The page profiles American fighters, including Matson, who have traveled to Syria to join the battle against IS.

Matson encouraged his Facebook followers to consider joining the YPG, directing those interested to visit the newly established YPG recruitment page: ""For all those looking to join the YPG... send them a private message. They will explain what you need for your journey and will organize travel arrangements for you. Thank you all for your patience and god bless.""

It's unclear how many Americans are now overseas but Matson said Wednesday there are ""hundreds.""

Neither the U.S. Army nor the Pentagon would comment on the travel of former veterans to Syria.

The YPG has identified two other Americans who have joined its defense forces. Brian Wilson of Ohio, and Jeremy Woodard, a former infantryman from Mississippi.

Wilson declined to be interviewed.

Woodard's brother, Allen, expressed frustration with Jeremy's decision to travel to Syria. In a public Facebook post last month, he wrote:

""I talk to him almost everyday and still don't really understand why the hell he did go over there but he is there now and nothing I can do about it now. I just hope he makes it back fine. I think the military failed him this time. He never got the war and stuff out of him and the VA's mental health didn't keep a watch on him... His reasoning and excuses for going over there just don't make sense at all."""
"355","It's not every night that a pizza delivery driver receives a $2,000 tip.

But that's what happened Thursday to one Ann Arbor driver who delivered a single pizza to a conference room full of more than 200 realtors from Michigan and northern Ohio on Thursday.

Pizza House delivery manager Brian LeFevre said he received a call Thursday morning from a man who said they wanted one pizza delivered to the Sheraton Hotel in Ann Arbor.

""They said they wanted it at 2:20 p.m. on the dot,"" LeFevre said. ""I gave it to our delivery driver and he went down there and took it to the front desk.""

LeFevre said his driver was escorted to a conference room where a man was up front with a microphone.


A video posted on YouTube shows the deliverer being stopped as he handed over the pizza and then presented with $2,084, letters of encouragement, a Visa gift card and lottery tickets -- all to cheers from the crowd. LeFevre said the driver, who identifies himself as Rob in the video but whose last name wasn't released, has worked at the restaurant about six years.

When he came back, LeFevre said, Rob was visibly happy.

""He was clearly pretty ecstatic about something so I asked him what's going on,"" Le said. ""He said, 'I just had a life-changing delivery.' He was kind of blown away.""

LeFevre said he's never seen a driver earn such a large tip.

""For one pizza, that's a pretty good day's work,"" he said. ""It's nice to be appreciated.""

Stacey McVey, team leader of Keller Williams Greater Cleveland West, said that at the company's annual conference, all the agents agreed to pitch in to show someone from the service industry their appreciation.

""Our company as a whole is very interested in doing things like that,"" she said. ""It's really important as businesses that we give back. We believe a group of people can come together and change a life and cause other people to think about how to change others' lives. People in the service industry, I think they're pretty under-appreciated. It's a lot of fun to do something like this.""

McVey said when the driver realized what was going on, it was a priceless moment.

""He was a little stunned,"" she said. ""Everyone was excited and you could kind of feel the energy in the room. This is the first time we've done anything over the top and this won't be the last.""

A group of Russians claim to have captured the best footage of bigfoot.

The adventurers spotted what they described as a hairy bear-sized humanoid that marched out of the woods before disappearing seconds later.

The recording came when a group of people from the city of Adygeisk set off in search of the mysterious creature after a local TV station reported that it had been sighted in a remote region.

They said they had questioned the people at a mountainside lodge who claimed to have seen the creature, and managed to get several independent confirmations that there was something out there.

CEN   Conclusive proof: A group claim to have spotted the beast in the woods

Eyewitness Ludmila Hristoforova who spoke to local TV station said: ""The creature was big, looking like a bear, but not a bear. From the door we’ve seen something big and shaggy.""

Another homeowner Andrei Kazarian said: ""I heard footsteps and we were pretty sure there was no one else around because we knew for sure everyone else was inside the house. Although we didn't see anyone, we saw its huge footprints.

7 terrifying mystery beasts that never existed

""They were 5 to 6 centimetres deep and couldn't come from a human foot. We took a plaster cast of them and we estimate that it probably would have taken about 200 kilos to press the snow down that much.""

The local team then set off to investigate, and as they headed off into the forest said they were stunned when they heard the crunching of snow, and managed to grab footage of a hairy creature as it emerged from the trees.

After taking a plaster cast of the alleged footprint, the group have now handed their findings to local scientists for analysis.

The footage has already attracted a lot of interest with some suggesting it was just a stunt to bring in tourists, and others convinced that this was the first form of conclusive proof that the yeti exists in the area.

"362","ELON, N.C. – A recent rumor claims that Elon University has banned the term “freshman” because it’s sexist. But the rumor is not true, according to the university.

A junior student at Elon University recently wrote an article for the College Fix, a website for students, claiming the school dropped the term and replaced it with “first year.”

The post claims it was an official move made by the school this fall to promote inclusivity, diversity, and ensure the campus does not promote sexist stereotypes or create a hostile and unsafe environment for female students. The National Review Online also picked up the story.

The article claimed the school implemented the term “first-year” in everything from its website to orientation workshops.

But Dan Anderson, vice president of university communications at Elon, told the Burlington Times-News there is no ban or new policy.

Anderson said the university uses the term “first-year” because it applies to more students than the term “freshman.”

He said the school uses “first-year” to describe any student in the first year at Elon, as opposed to a recent high school graduate.

“Elon has done what most schools have done and gone to using ‘first-year’ more frequently because ‘first-year’ encompasses more than just traditional freshmen,” Anderson said. “We still use ‘freshman’ when it refers to traditional students who come right out of high school.”

The student who wrote the original story said she became curious when she was writing a story for the school newspaper and her editor changed the word “freshman” to first-year.”

She said she was surprised her story got as much attention as it did and hopes it didn’t put the school in a bad light.

Islamic State militants are launching bombs containing live scorpions as the latest terror weapon in Iraq.

Canisters of the creatures are being blasted into towns and villages, according to a British military expert who has just returned from the country.

Hamish de Bretton-Gordon, ex-head of chemical and biological weapons for the Army and Nato, said: “It’s madness. IS have improvised devices to launch them.

""They promote the fact that they are doing it and it creates panic.

“Scorpions are robust – even if they are launched a couple of miles, when the canister breaks thousands are flung out and start crawling all around.

""Some scorpions are very poisonous but the main thing is creating fear.""

He said the 2ft bombs were not causing mass casualties but had a massive “psychological impact”.

Mr de Bretton-Gordon – of Avon Protection Systems – returned from Baghdad last week, where he was advising security forces.

Senior Iraqi officials reported the beasts were being used to target civilian areas in the north of the country.

The weapon harks back to the scorpions stuffed into pots and launched by Iraqis thousands of years ago – in 198 AD.

"365","A lot of folks are buzzing about 17-year-old Stuyvesant High School senior Mohammed ""Mo"" Islam who is rumored to have made $72 million from trading.

New York Magazine's Jessica Pressler profiled him in a recent issue.

But a number of folks who know Islam told Business Insider that they strongly believe that the $72 million figure is just a rumor - a rumor that Islam hasn't denied.

In the article, he acknowledged to Pressler over caviar and apple juice that his net worth was in the ""high eight figures.""

A source familiar with the story told Business Insider that Islam is not worth $72 million. The source believes it's a rumor started by Islam's friends or partners that was perpetuated by the New York Magazine article.

Pressler has also defended the story. She Tweeted that she saw a bank statement with the eight figures and is comfortable with what's in the piece. She also Tweeted that New York Magazine ""is not a financial publication.""

Business Insider actually featured Islam on our list of ""20 Under 20"" in finance just over a year ago. He was nominated by his peers.

In a phone interview on Monday Islam's partner Damir Tulemagabetov, who was also in the New York Magazine article, said the $72 million figure isn't necessarily completely accurate.

""Let me put it this way...it's stated as a rumor,"" Tulemaganbetov told us when we asked him if he would deny the $72 million figure. He was with Islam in a car headed to CNBC's studios in New Jersey.

""All the hype, [Islam] deserves it,"" Tulemaganbetov said. Adding that he is ""pretty sure"" Islam is a ""a great trader"" and that he's a ""genius.""

Business Insider asked for audited numbers or P&L statements to prove that Islam's networth is close to $72 million. Tulemaganbetov refused.

Islam himself did not respond to our email this morning requesting the numbers. He also would not get on the phone when Business Insider learned he was riding in the car to CNBC.

The investment club for young traders, of which Islam is a member, sent Business Insider this statement regarding the $72 million figure:

It has been brought to the attention of the Leaders Investment Club that Mohammed Islam has been rumored to have made $72,000,000 through making trades in the stock market. After performing due diligence and talking with Mohammed Islam himself, we have determined that these claims are false and simply been blown up by the media in the interests of sensationalism.

Islam's partner Tulemaganbetov, however, would not be that clear in his coversation with Business Insider.

""We can't just talk about the numbers. It's not just about the money,"" Tulemaganbetov said. ""We're on the verge of a lot of great things in our lives so we can't just focus on providing you the statements. We're on the verge of a lot of great things. We are going to talk to CNBC.""

Again, Business Insider pressed the issue of the P&L statements.

""All those statements...that's good for you. We know what we're doing. We're managing this whole hype and everything. We are trying to work with it. We were never expecting it and never denied. You have no proof.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that Islam didn't expect all the attention. He just expected a magazine article.

""The guy became famous all over the world in 24 hours. He's all over the world. The next thing we wake up and he's famous. This guy is a celebrity all over the world right now.""

Tulemaganbetov told us that they were going to ""make it clear on CNBC.""

"366","But an official says it would be ""irresponsible"" to identify the bodies as the missing students

A mass grave with an unconfirmed number of bodies was discovered in a part of Mexico near to where 43 college students were abducted, authorities announced Saturday night.

Guerrero State Attorney General Iñaky Blanco said there was a connection between the burial site and the students’ disappearance from a teachers’ college the previous weekend, the Wall Street Journal reports. However, Blanco said it would be “irresponsible” without DNA tests to confirm that the bodies were the missing students.

Mexico’s Proceso, citing anonymous sources, reported that 20 bodies had been discovered. The Associated Press reports that six pits had been discovered but did not report a body count.

The students disappeared after clashing with police during a protest that turned violent. Officials have detained 30 people, including 22 police officers, in the case. Blanco said that a local criminal organization, Los Guerreros Unidos, was connected with the violence and the disappearances.

Close to 100,000 Mexicans have been killed or gone missing in drug-related violence since 2006, when former President Felipe Calderon ordered the country’s military to reclaim parts of the country under the influence of drug cartels.

"370","Ignoring the idiotic instances where people intentionally started bending iPhone 6 units in stores just to prove it can be done, Apple did have an iPhone 6 Bendgate problem, which genuinely affected some early buyers. Early reports have shown that the iPhone 6 Plus was more prone to bending than its smaller sibling, with some users explaining why the iPhone 6 Plus can bend in a certain way — apparently the area around the bottom volume button lacks the kind of reinforcement that can prevent bending. However, Apple might have fixed the issue, one Reddit user seems to indicate.

Redditor doctorkuddles says that he just purchased an 128GB iPhone 6 Plus that feels different than his wife’s early 16GB iPhone 6 Plus model.

“I can’t prove anything. I can only look at my iPhone 6 Plus I got yesterday, and the 6 Plus my wife got on September 20th,” he explains. “We have identical phones minus the GB size (I have 128GB, she has the 16GB) Both are space gray. I started looking at both phones closely.

“First difference I noticed is the smoothness on the week one phone compared to the week 6 (?) phone. Completely softer and smoother. The second difference I noted was when I started tapping (‘flicking’) the back and sides of both phones. Right where the previous ‘bends’ were in previous 6 Pluses (above and below the volume rocker), there is a night and day difference in sound,” he adds.

doctorkuddles further says he used a stethoscope to listen to the iPhone 6 Plus and found that his 128GB phone sounds “much more dull toned, indicating to me it’s more solid” whereas “her phone had a lot more percussion sound, indicating that area was previously hollow”

He then took it under a microscope, without dismantling it. He looked through the cracks of the volume buttons and spotted a “red colored object placed in the volume down button crank.”

Furthermore, he weighed and measured both devices and found out that while both devices are identical in size, the 128GB version is 21g heavier than the 16GB model.

“I just don’t see the memory being that much heavier,” he said.

No actual images or videos of any of these findings have been published, so it’s not clear whether doctorkuddles has actually discovered anything.

Interestingly, he contacted the teardown experts at iFixit on the matter, who purchased a brand new 128GB iPhone 6 Plus and weighed it.

“It weighs 173.5 grams, a whopping 0.8 grams more than the Day One unit,” iFixit’s mdjorie wrote on the same Reddit thread. “I don’t know what’s up with your new unit, OP, but our new unit definitely doesn’t weigh 21 grams more than the Day One device.”

It’s not clear whether Apple made any internal design changes to its iPhones since the Bendgate issue was first reported, or whether it would be able to roll out changes so fast in case it did. But a previous report did reveal that Apple takes product launch-related issues and flaws very seriously and looks to fix problems as fast as possible following their discovery."
"371","Bowe Bergdahl exited Taliban captivity in exchange for the U.S. releasing five jihadists to the government of Qatar, and now a U.S. senator claims those jihadists are “in touch” with an al-Qaida affiliate, which would confirm the fears of critics who objected to the deal made by the Obama administration.

CNN reported on January 29 that at least one of the five jihadists “has attempted to return to militant activity.”

“Several U.S. officials across different agencies and branches of the U.S. government have confirmed key details to CNN. The White House referred CNN to the Pentagon.”

CNN added that the U.S. allegedly believes this based on “an ongoing U.S. intelligence program to secretly intercept and monitor all of their communications in Qatar.”

Pentagon suspects detainee exchanged for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl attempting militant activity @barbarastarrcnn reports http://t.co/CWPGE3VWDF

— Barbara Starr (@barbarastarrcnn) January 29, 2015

The Associated Press provided a similar report, adding a named official to back up the assertion that the jihadists released for Bergdahl are now looking to return to terrorism.

“Sen. Lindsey Graham said Thursday that the Taliban detainees released from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl have been in touch with members of the al-Qaida linked Haqqani network, yet all five still are being monitored in Qatar.”

Graham’s alleged assertions about the status of the five jihadists apparently is based on his visit to Qatar. The AP said that Graham “had been afraid that one of the detainees had left the country,” although the Qatari government later assured him that all five jihadists remained in its borders, per the agreement with the U.S. government.

This latest news involving the terrorists exchanged for Bergdahl comes at a time when the Obama administration is dealing with rumors regarding the ongoing investigation into his conduct leading up to his capture.

The Inquisitr previously reported that some pundits and news outlets are claiming the government has decided to charge Bergdahl with desertion.

However, the U.S. Department of Defense flatly denies such allegations. Meanwhile, this denial has caused more speculation on how the unofficial allegations and official denial of those allegations might be part of an ongoing fight behind the scenes.

In fact, the Daily Signal argued the seemingly inconsistent “statements are not inconsistent.”

“Shaffer and Miklaszewski report that Bergdahl will be charged—ostensibly soon. Kirby is merely saying Bergdahl has not been charged yet. And by saying Bergdahl has not had charges referred against him, he is betting the press and public don’t understand the unique procedural steps in the court-martial process.”

The White House had not issued a statement on the latest reports regarding the alleged attempt of one or more of the jihadists released for Bergdahl to return to terrorism as of the time of the publication of this article.

"372","Multiple Iraqi and Kurdish media sources have claimed that some Islamic State (ISIS) militants in Mosul, Iraq, have contracted the deadly Ebola virus, Mashable reports.

The Iraqi outlets reportedly claimed that Ebola had started to spread in a Mosul hospital. The city, known as ISIS’s most important strategic stronghold in Iraq, has been under the control of the Islamic State since June.

Christy Feig, the World Health Organization (WHO) director of communications, told Mashable, “We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.” She said that WHO had reached out to authorities and asked if they needed help investigating the matter.

Kurdish media network Xendan reported that ISIS jihadists’ symptoms were similar to those shown by someone who has contracted Ebola. However, it is highly uncertain whether Mosul health authorities have the means, tools, or skill-set necessary to test for Ebola, given the current hostile environment in the area.

In late December, the Islamic State reportedly executed doctors who refused to treat their militant jihadis. The Washington Post said of the ongoing situation in Mosul, “Services are collapsing, prices are soaring, and medicines are scarce in towns and cities across the ‘caliphate’ proclaimed in Iraq and Syria by ISIS.”

Iraq’s pro-government Al Sabaah (The Morning) daily newspaper reported that Ebola made its way into Mosul through Africa-based Islamist “terrorists” who then linked up with ISIS. Mashable notes, however, that the majority of ISIS recruits in Africa have come from countries that have not reported any Ebola cases, such as Tunisia, Egypt, Morocco, Libya, and others.

Meanwhile, Mosul’s liberation remains a strategic priority for Iraqi forces and the U.S.-led coalition. Mosul has been described as ISIS’s de facto capital in Iraq. While under ISIS control, many of the city’s one million residents have lived under fear of severe punishment or execution should they not comply with the jihadists’ mandates."
"373","As Apple gears up to launch the Apple Watch in April this year, Tim Cook while talking to an employee at the Apple Store spilled some extra information about the wearable before the launch. He also gave a tentative time-frame as to when Apple Pay will be reaching Europe. Also, analysts have predicted what Apple might offer at the time of its smartwatch launch.

While we already know that Apple Watch will be water resistant, Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple further confirmed it as shower-proof, while chatting with a Kurfurstendamm Apple Store (Berlin) employee. Reported by iGen (via 9to5Mac), the CEO said that he always wears the watch - ""even in the shower"". Cook added that he puts his Apple Watch on charge every night, which reconfirms the expected battery life from Apple's previous statements and multiple reports.

Regarding Apple Pay, Cook said that the firm plans to bring the service to Europe not ""before the end of the year."" The announcement is somewhat a contradiction to announcements by UK banks, which in the recent past stated they were in talks to bring the Apple Pay system by the first half of 2015. According to Cook, the mobile payment system should reach Canada as soon as next month.

Meanwhile, Trip Chowdhry, an analyst from Global Equities Research has predicted that Apple might introduce as many as 100,000 apps for the Apple Watch by time it gets launched. The huge number comes from six ""Apple Watch-Kit hackathons"" in the past few months, which Chowdhry attended, according to a Barrons blog post.

He further states that the $350 (roughly Rs. 21,700) price tag for the smartwatch seems to be no issue because ""On an average an Apple Watch user will have 100 Apps installed, and one way to think about it is that the consumer is getting 100 devices for $350..i.e. $3.50 (roughly Rs. 217) per device,"" considering each app and its function as a single device.

As for the sales, Apple is being expected to ship almost 42 million units by December this year. ""Since Apple Watch extends iPhone functionality and provides user convenience with 'Glance' and 'Notifications' to an iPhone User, almost every current iPhone user, which are about 350 million users, will also be an Apple Watch user,"" he explains.

The author, known only as Lena, said in her blog that she was ready to have a child but because of her ""bad experiences with men"" she had an abortion when she discovered the baby's sex, the Metro has reported.

In the blog she says she found out she was pregnant in 2012 and describes the father as ‘the donator’.

She also claims to be a feminist, fighting women’s rights ""to the point of eschewing a career"".

The woman wrote when she found out she was having a boy, she was ""in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with"".

She continued: ""A few days later, I went in for the procedure, as it was fairly later in my pregnancy, I was aware there were certain risks, but it went off without a hitch...I felt strong. I had done something positive, something that would actually make a difference, something good, even though as I would find out, many others wouldn’t see it that way.""

The blogger says she went on to give birth to a ""beautiful"" baby girl.

She says: ""I have endured a lot regarding my first pregnancy, but I don’t care. Sometimes, even allies will turn on you, but I don’t care.

""I stand by my decision to abort my baby because it was a male.

""I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

""If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.""

But her comments have triggered a backlash online and speculation as to whether her comments are genuine.

Sex selection abortion is expected to be made officially illegal in the UK under an amendment to the Serious Crime Bill, which has the backing of 70 MPs.

The bill has completed its committee stage in the Commons and is intended to clarify the law on sex selective abortion.

It also contains new measures to combat domestic violence and female genital mutilation (FGM).

An alliance of faith and women's groups representing Muslims, Sikhs and Hindus has backed the amendment and said ""not enough is being done"" to stop the practice, the Daily Telegraph reported today."

Boston.com has taken professor Ben Edelman to task over the dispute in a series of stories. Last night, the website posted a story headlined: “Ben Edelman Appears to Have Sent Racist Email to Chinese Restaurant Owner. Today.”

“Could it be Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman has a problem with people of Asian descent?” the story said. It also included what purported to be the text of emails from Edelman containing a racial slur, which Boston.com said had been provided to the website by the restaurant owner.

Edelman has reportedly denied sending such an email.

He could not be reached for comment by the Herald last night.

The Boston.com story, which gained significant traction on the Internet, was replaced by an editor’s note that reads: “Earlier tonight, Boston.com published a piece suggesting Harvard Business School Professor Ben Edelman sent an email with racist overtones to Sichuan Garden.

"377","SEOUL — Early signs yesterday indicated that Mr Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has been absent from public view for more than a month, skipped an important annual ritual, which was likely to fuel further speculation about his whereabouts and even his grip on power.

Yesterday was the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea. Since taking over the top leadership position after the death of his father, longtime ruler Kim Jong-il, in late 2011, the younger Kim had marked the beginning of this important national holiday by leading top military and party officials on a midnight visit to the Kumsusan mausoleum in Pyongyang.

By Friday morning, the state-run media had made no mention of such a visit, which would have taken place at midnight on Thursday. The gigantic Kumsusan Palace of the Sun — where the mummified bodies of Mr Kim’s father and his grandfather, the founding president of North Korea, Kim Il-sung, lie in state — is among the most sacred places in the country.

During the anniversary last year, Mr Kim and his wife also attended the performance of a national choir and the dedication of new buildings. If he did the same this year, the news would probably have been reported in the North Korean media. No public appearance by the leader has been shown in the media since Sept 3.

Speculation escalated after the state-run Korean Central Television confirmed that Mr Kim was not feeling well and showed him limping during a visit to a factory in August. He was first seen limping on North Korean television in July.

While he was absent from public view, Mr Kim continued his work, sending letters to young party cadets and workers, state media said.

South Korean officials and analysts have said the young and obese North Korean leader may be suffering from health problems, such as gout. One Seoul-based website, run by North Korean defectors, recently reported that many of Mr Kim’s daily duties had been taken over by his younger sister, Ms Kim Yo-jong, while he was being treated for health issues caused by his excessive eating and drinking.

A source with access to Pyongyang’s leadership said on Thursday that Mr Kim is in firm control of his government, but had hurt his leg while inspecting military exercises, reported Reuters. The source, who has close ties to Pyongyang and Beijing, said: “He ordered all the generals to take part in drills and he took part, too. They were crawling and running and rolling around, and he pulled a tendon.”

“He injured his ankle and knee around late August or early September while drilling because he is overweight. He limped around in the beginning, but the injury worsened,” the source told Reuters.

But on the Internet, bloggers were spreading rumours, with no evidence, that Mr Kim, believed to be about 30, might have been sidelined by a coup engineered by some of the old disgruntled generals. AGENCIES"

"381","“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is one of the most highly anticipated movies of 2015 that is scheduled to be released during winter. The latest reports, however, claim that J.J. Abrams, the director of the seventh episode of the epic space opera, wants an early release date for his movie.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” is currently scheduled to be released on Dec. 18, 2015. Based on YouTuber Votesaxon 07’s video, Movie Pilot reports that J.J. Abrams wants to release “Episode 7” in the summer of 2015. The report by the aforementioned entertainment news publication claims that the 48-year-old director made the announcement at the Visual Effects Society Awards 2015.

The publication claims that the reason why J.J. Abrams wants to release “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” almost six months before its scheduled date is the alleged plot and images leaks from the sets and script. The moviemaker is now worried that these plot leaks will make the film “predictable and not worth watching” for the audience.

According to the website, moving the release date forward would be “an extremely brave move,” putting it up against other fan-favourite releases such as “Avengers: Age of Ultron,” “Jurassic World” and “Ant-Man.” However, shifting the release date means a lot of work for the moviemakers and the studio. Meanwhile, Ikwiz reports that Disney is “seriously” considering J.J. Abrams' demand of summer release of “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

Fans must note that these reports lack official comments from the associated parties; thus, the information must be taken with a pinch of salt. However, fans know that Disney is seriously dealing with the issue of image leak. Recently, the studio issued a subpoena over the leak of images from “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.”

In additional news, J.J. Abrams finally broke his silence on the controversy over the new lightsaber that debuted in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens” trailer. Speaking to Collider at a Hollywood event, the director admitted receiving tons of emails arguing about the new lightsaber and its functionality.

""It's been the funniest thing to see the arguments that have developed over this thing,” J.J Abrams said. ""This was not done without a lot of conversation. It's fun to see people have the conversation that we had, but in reverse,” the director explained.

“Star Wars: The Force Awakens” features John Boyega as Finn, Daisy Ridley as Rey, Oscar Isaac as Poe Dameron, Harrison For as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Leia, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and Domhnall Gleeson, Max von Sydow and Adam Driver, all in unspecified roles. Stay tuned for more updates.

"382","Fox & Friends got very excited Thursday morning over rumors, which they credited to Jordanian TV, that King Abdullah of Jordan had potentially participated in retaliatory airstrikes against ISIS after the immolation death of Jordanian pilot Muath al-Kasaesbeh.

“What a statement that would make,” Steve Doocy said.

“He is stepping up with strong leadership and clarity,” Elisabeth Hasselbeck said. “What is our president doing?

Fox aired photos of of King Abdullah in flight gear, which had been making the rounds on Twitter since Wednesday evening:

Al Arabiya confirmed that Abdullah did not take part in any air strikes, and contradicted Doocy’s statement that he was a pilot:

Meanwhile, a Jordanian government official on Thursday told Al Arabiya News that King Abdullah was not flying missions against ISIS himself, after local media reports – also taken by some international outlets – indicated he is set to do so. The official also noted that observers should refrain from calling King Abdullah a fighter pilot as he does not officially hold the title. He is, however, the commander-in-chief of the Jordanian Air Force. The king is a trained combatant, part of the parachute brigade and flies civilian planes and helicopters, the official added.

Doocy quietly corrected he record at the end of the next segment. “By the way, I should point out we understand that so far the king has not taken part in any of the raids,” Doocy said. “But he may going forward.” What a statement that would make.

"383","The sale of a private island in Lake Mälaren has received international attention, thanks to the assertion that it is Tiger Woods who sells it. But that's not true - the true owner is a Swedish millionaire.

""If you have 45 million over and want to buy tiger woods house on an island in Lake Mälaren? Then it exactly right now you have the chance. ""

Thus wrote radio station Mix Megapol programs last morning on Facebook on January 8, and linked to an object in the broker real estate agency. Anyone who clicked on the link found the island of Great Rullingen, a luxurious island dream equipped with everything from wine cellars to the ancient castle.

At last morning's mail was shared over 300 times, and it was not just those who let themselves be impressed by the island. Even internationally the news that golf star Tiger Woods is now selling its Swedish island become widespread - it is published by the British The Telegraph and the Daily Mail , US New York Post o ch LA Times , and Yahoo .

The only problem with the story is that Göteborgs-Posten drew attention already January 9, that the island is not at all belong to Tiger Woods. It says Johan Vesterberg on estate agency, who do not know how it is that the data started to circulate.

- We have had this island for sale in a few months, and it started to pop up articles around the world that it was Tiger Woods who owned it. How it has started, we have no idea, says Vesterberg.

In several articles written about the island quoted a Sabine Rollinger, an employee of the broker Vladi Private Islands. To The Telegraph, she says for example that Woods took the island, but that after his divorce with Swedish exhustrun Elin Nordegren ""did not need it anymore.""

But when Viral Inspector reaches Rollinger she writes in an email, ""to avoid misunderstanding"" that the island is not owned by Tiger Woods, but by a ""Swedish millionaire"".

- He has commissioned us to sell it for him. As we understood it was designed originally for Tiger Woods and his wife. When their marriage suddenly ran out, he needed, however, it no longer writes Rollinger in an email.

It rejects, however, Johan Vesterberg on estate agency.

- It is not owned by Tiger Woods, and what we know, he has never owned it. The present owners have built it on the island now, and he did not for Tiger Woods, but for my part, he says.

It's not the first time that Big roll no is up for sale. Already in 2011 attracted the attention of the media when it could be sold for 75 million. However, there was no one who bought the island at the time, and now the price has thus been reduced by 30 million.

If you are conspiratorially inclined, of course, think it is very appropriate to task about Tiger Woods now gives the sales international attention. But that's not the broker real estate agency who planted the story, at least not according to Johan Vesterberg.

- It is definitely not a negative to get noticed in this way. It is not no way we're working on, but we will not say no to the attention even if it is not true, he says."
"384","What's thought to be an audio recording of the shooting death of Michael Brown has reportedly surfaced. According to CNN, an unidentified man, who has since been interviewed by the FBI, is said to have managed to record the incident in which Michael Brown was shot by Officer Darren Wilson earlier this month, setting off a national firestorm. 

The most notable tidbit from the short recording (and what will become subject to the most immediately scrutiny and parsing) is the existence of two distinct volleys of gunfire from Officer Darren Wilson's weapon. From CNN:

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

The man who recorded the shooting was talking to someone on video chat when the sounds of gunfire erupted in the background. The Daily Mail added:

Lopa Blumenthal, the attorney for the unidentified man who recorded the alleged gunfire nearby said that she believed the audio shows, if it is authentic, that Officer Wilson had a clear 'point of contemplation' while pulling the trigger and aiming at Brown.""

Also of some serious importance, should the tape's authenticity be confirmed, is the fact that ten (or, by some counts, eleven) shots were fired at Brown by Wilson. 

Here is the segment as it aired on CNN with the audio recording:"
"385","Rome| An Italian expert studying a first century document written by the Roman historian Marcus Velleius Paterculus that was recently discovered in the archives of the Vatican, found what is presumed to be the first eyewitness account ever recorded of a miracle of Jesus Christ. The author describes a scene that he allegedly witnessed, in which a prophet and teacher that he names Iēsous de Nazarenus, resuscitated a stillborn boy and handed him back to his mother.

Historian and archivist Ignazio Perrucci, was hired by the Vatican authorities in 2012, to sort, analyze and classify some 6,000 ancient documents that had been uncovered in the gigantic archive vaults. He was already very excited when he noticed that the author of the text was the famous Roman historian Velleius, but he was completely stunned when he realized the nature of the content.

Professor Perrucci found the text in the archives of the Vatican, while searching amongst a bundle of personal letters and other trivial documents dating from the Roman era.

The text as a whole is a narrative of the author’s return journey from Parthia to Rome that occurred in 31 AD, recorded in a highly rhetorical style of four sheets of parchment. He describes many different episodes taking place during his trip, like a a violent sandstorm in Mesopotamia and visit to a temple in Melitta (modern day Mdina, in Malta).

The part of the text that really caught M. Perrucci’s attention is an episode taking place in the city of Sebaste (near modern day Nablus, in the West Bank). The author first describes the arrival of a great leader in the town with a group of disciples and followers, causing many of the lower class people from neighbouring villages to gather around them. According to Velleius, that great man’s name was Iēsous de Nazarenus, a Greco-Latin translation of Jesus’ Hebrew name, Yeshua haNotzri.

Upon entering town, Jesus would have visited the house of a woman named Elisheba, who had just given birth to a stillborn child. Jesus picked up the dead child and uttered a prayer in Aramaic to the heavens, which unfortunately the author describes as “immensus”, meaning incomprehensible. To the crowd’s surprise and amazement, the baby came back to life almost immediately, crying and squirming like a healthy newborn.

Marcus Velleius Paterculus, being a Roman officer of Campanian origins, seems to perceive Jesus Christ as a great doctor and miracle man, without associating him in any way to the Jewish concept of Messiah.

Many tests and analysis have been realized over the last weeks to determine the authenticity of the manuscript. The composition of the parchment and ink, the literary style and handwriting have all been carefully scrutinized and were considered to be entirely legitimate. The dating analysis also revealed that the sheepskin parchment on which the text is written, does indeed date from the 1st century of this era, more precisely from between 20-45 AD.

This new text from an author known for his reliability, brings a brand new perspective on the life of the historical character that is Jesus of Nazareth. It comes to confirm the Gospels on the facts that he was known for accomplishing miracles and that his sheer presence in a town was enough to attract crowds of people.

A complete and official translation of the document should be made available online in many different languages over the next few weeks, but the impact of the discovery is already felt in the scientific community. Many scholars have already saluted the finding as one of the greatest breakthrough ever realized in the study of the historical life of Jesus, while others have expressed doubts about the conclusions of Professor Perrucci and demand for more tests to be performed by other scientific institutions before drawing any conclusions."

The USDA’s Food Safety Inspection Service went on Twitter to debunk the hoax, saying the agency would post any real recalls on its website.


Snopes.com—the premier debunker of internet myths—said the article was fake.

And the folks at Snopes.com have been talking turkey plenty this month.

The turkey farm—“Texas Prime Turkey Farm”—doesn’t exist anywhere in Texas, Snopes.com found. In addition, the website that posted the story (“Daily Buzz Live”) frequently spreads outrageous stories and false claims."

A boy who was almost killed when he was knocked out by a huge electrical shock claims he has become a LIVING MAGNET with superpowers like those of Marvel's Magneto.

Nikolai Kryaglyachenko, 12, was blasted across the pavement when he leant briefly against a lamppost that was live from a faulty wire.

""When I came round I felt groggy but managed to get home and told my mum what had happened,"" he said.

""When I woke up the next day and got out of bed I found some coins that had been lying on the mattress had stuck to my body.

""Then when I was having breakfast and dropped my spoon, it stuck to my chest.""

Europics   'Superpowers': Nikolai Kryaglyachenko wants to be a superhero when he grows up

Nikolai said he was a keen fan of comics and, believing that maybe he had developed some sort of super magnetic power to attract metal like Magneto, had decided to put it to the test.

""I can do things I couldn't do before but I don't have a lot of control over it,"" he said.

""Even when I do not want to do it, I still attract things.

""Once I even attracted a glass - it just moved towards me.""

Nikolai added that he has now decided instead of a fireman he wants to be a superhero when he is older, saying that he would want to do something that helped people, and the job would certainly fulfil that role.

Europics   Look at me: Nikolai Kryaglyachenko 'performs' for his classmates

He has also found himself one of the most popular boys at school with many of his classmates asking him to demonstrate his superpowers, and Nikolai even claims that he seems to be able to share his power.

According to his classmates, he can influence others so that other people turn into live magnets as well.

Nikolai's classmate, Vika Balandina, said: ""I could even hang a ladle on my nose.""

Stories about ""living magnets"" began to appear at least in the middle of the 19th century.

In 2004, the story of a Russian factory worker Leonid Tenkaev and his family received extensive media coverage when he appeared to obtain the ability to attract objects after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster.

"390","According to The Washington Post, Emwazi grew up in a well-to-do family in west London. He is believed to have traveled to Syria around 2012 and to have later joined the militant group.

He is said to have graduated from college with a degree in computer programming at the University of Westminster.

The militant has appeared in a series of videos in which hostages, including British aid worker Alan Henning, were brutally murdered.

""I have no doubt that Mohammed is Jihadi John,"" said one of his close friends who identified him in an interview with The Washington Post. ""He was like a brother to me... I am sure it is him.""

Asim Qureshi, research director at the rights group, CAGE, said after watching one of the videos: ""There was an extremely strong resemblance. This is making me feel fairly certain that this is the same person.""

'Counter-terrorism'
Scotland Yard has refused to confirm the reports.

Commander Richard Walton, head of the Met's Counter Terrorism Command, said: ""We have previously asked media outlets not to speculate about the details of our investigation on the basis that life is at risk.

""We are not going to confirm the identity of anyone at this stage or give an update on the progress of this live counter-terrorism investigation.""

From Britain to Syria via Kuwait, Tanzania and the Netherlands
Emwazi is understood to have arrived in Britain as a young boy, aged six, after being born in Kuwait. Growing up in west London, he was described as a ""polite, mild-mannered"" man with a penchant for wearing stylish clothes.

It was during a trip to Tanzania in August 2009 that Emwazi's life direction is thought to have started to change. Once landing in Dar es Salaam on the supposed Safari trip with two friends, he alleged he was detained by gun-wielding Tanzanian police and held overnight.

The trio were eventually refused entry to Tanzania and returned to the Netherlands, where they said they were questioned by MI5 agents who accused them of having links to Islamic extremists.

An article in The Independent in May 2010 outlines the allegations. Upon returning to the UK, Emwazi was reportedly on the radar of MI5, who warned him that he was on a terror watch list which prevented him travelling to any Muslim country.

He is later understood to have filed a complaint with the Independent Police Complaints Commission over his treatment.

Emwazi later moved to Kuwait, where he got a job at a computer company. But on a visit to London in June 2010, it is understood he was detained once again by counter-terrorism officials and prevented from flying back.

Two years later he was apparently in Syria fighting alongside IS.

His first public appearance was last August in a video of the murder of American journalist James Foley in August, dressed in black with only his eyes visible. He later reappeared in videos of the beheadings of US journalist Steven Sotloff, British aid worker David Haines, American aid worker Peter Kassig and British charity worker Alan Henning.

British and US security services have previously inferred that they knew his identity, but Thursday morning's developments and naming appear to have taken authorities by surprise.

A spokesman for the Foreign Office said: ""There is an ongoing police investigation into the murder of hostages by so-called ISIL in Syria. We are not going to give a running commentary on any element of a live operational security investigation."""

'The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,' a Homeland Security spokesman said in a statement, using the administration's preferred alternative acronym for the group.

'DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.'

CBS News reported Wednesday that one of Hunter's sources 'nuanced their claims' after the Fox broadcast, saying that some of the people he referred to may have been 'ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army.'

The FSA is an ISIS foe, not an ally.

Hunter's spokesman pushed back, defending his claim.

“The congressman was conveying what he knows – and what he was told,' the spokesperson said in a statement.

'It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing – it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.'

Hunter, like many in the GOP, has advocated in the past for strengthening America's border security to the south, a demand that has largely fallen on deaf ears during the Obama presidency.

During a 2013 Senate hearing, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said that due to the administration's 'significant progress and efforts ... our borders have, in fact, never been stronger.'

But Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, claimed Tuesday that the nation's 1,933-mile southern border represents ISIS's best hope of waging war on the U.S.

'If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,' he said. 'It's that simple.'

'ISIS doesn't have a navy, they don't have an air force, they don't have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border – which they already have.'

'You're talking about OUR southern border?' Fox host Greta can Susteren was shocked to hear Hunter's claim that ISIS is infiltrating the US

Host Greta Van Susteren was caught flat-footed. 'Are you talking about ours?' she asked. 'You're talking about our southern border? You're not talking about the southern border of Iraq?'

'They aren't flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,' he replied, 'but they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico.'

The three-term congressman cited a similar fear that Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Martin Dempsey expressed during an August 21 Pentagon press briefing.

Dempsey called ISIS 'an immediate threat ... because of open borders and immigration issues.'

Hunter said his information came directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which has a 20,000-strong army of agents patrolling the borders in Texas, Arizona, New Mexico and California.

'I've asked the border patrol,' he said, adding that he was told about the ten ISIS fighters who were caught crossing the border.

'If they catch five or ten of them, then you know there's gonna be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol,' he said. 'But that's how you know: All you have to do is ask the border patrol.'

The government watchdog group Judicial Watch claimed in August that ISIS terrorists were 'planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.'

The group said a 'warning bulletin for an imminent terrorist attack' had been issued to 'agents across a number of Homeland Security, Justice and Defense agencies,'instructing them 'to aggressively work all possible leads and sources' to prevent the attacks.

The Department of Homeland Security flatly denied that in a statement to MailOnline.

'We are aware of absolutely nothing credible to substantiate this claim,' a bewildered DHS spokesman said

'In Mexico? I haven't seen that at all.'

Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said on the same day Judicial Watch made its claims that his agency and the FBI were 'unaware of any specific, credible threat to the U.S. homeland' from the terror network."

The ISIS leader was reportedly killed during an air strike in the city of Mosul, which ISIS forces took over this summer.

Pentagon Spokesman Col. Steve Warren could not confirm the deaths and said ISIS leaders had not been targeted. But he added that if ISIS leaders were embedded “inside troop formations they are likely to be killed.”

A number of news outlets and websites have published the unverified photo and news about the death of al-Baghdadi by US airstrikes. IraqiNews.com has been unable to verify the photo and claim that al-Baghdadi was killed."
"395","New York City—a generally liberal city whose marijuana laws have remained notoriously strict even as drug policies have been reformed in other areas of the country—may begin instructing police officers to issue tickets to individuals found in possession of marijuana rather than arresting them. The New York Times' Joseph Goldstein has the scoop:

People found with small amounts of marijuana would be issued court summonses and be allowed to continue on their way without being handcuffed and taken to station houses for fingerprinting.

The change would remake the way the police in New York City handle the most common drug offenses and would represent Mayor Bill de Blasio’s most significant effort since taking office to address the enduring effects of the department’s excessive stop-and-frisk practices.

Key questions about the policy remain unanswered, the Times reports, including whether public use of marijuana will be treated the same as possession and whether marijuana tickets will be recorded on citizens' criminal records."
"396","Islamist militias in Libya took control of nearly a dozen commercial jetliners last month, and Western intelligence agencies recently issued a warning that the jets could be used in terrorist attacks across North Africa.

Intelligence reports of the stolen jetliners were distributed within the U.S. government over the past two weeks and included a warning that one or more of the aircraft could be used in an attack later this month on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against New York and Washington, said U.S. officials familiar with the reports.

“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing,” said one official. “We found out on Sept. 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.”

The official noted that the reports also come three weeks before the second anniversary of the terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.


A senior State Department counterterrorism official declined to comment on reports of the stolen jetliners. A second State department official sought to downplay the reports. “We can’t confirm that,” he said.

The officials said U.S. intelligence agencies have not confirmed the aircraft theft after the takeover of Tripoli International Airport in late August, and are attempting to locate all aircraft owned by two Libyan state-owned airline companies."

Parents of the girls, who are aged between 13 and 15-years-old, are furious at the school and say the children were not properly supervised.

The girls, from the Bosnian town of Banja Luka, were in the capital of Sarajevo to visit Museums and historical sites.

While the parents are angry at the school administrators, the teachers say the blame lies with the parents, who they claim have failed to teach their children about safe sex.

The case has reignited an ongoing national discussion in Bosnia concerning the worrying increase in teenage pregnancies.

"398","(CNN) -- Could a newly released audio provide more clues on what led up to Michael Brown's shooting death?

The FBI has questioned a man who says he recorded audio of gunfire at the time Brown was shot by Ferguson, Missouri, police on August 9, the man's attorney told CNN.

In the recording, a quick series of shots can be heard, followed by a pause and then another quick succession of shots.

Forensic audio expert Paul Ginsberg analyzed the recording and said he detected at least 10 gunshots -- a cluster of six, followed by four.

""I was very concerned about that pause ... because it's not just the number of gunshots, it's how they're fired,"" the man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, told CNN's Don Lemon. ""And that has a huge relevance on how this case might finally end up.""

The man, who asked that his identity not be revealed, lives near the site of the shooting and was close enough to have heard the gunshots, his attorney said.

He was speaking to a friend on a video chat service and happened to be recording the conversation at the same time Brown was shot, Blumenthal said.

The attorney said she learned of the man's recording late last week from a mutual friend.

""I had to get his consent before I could reach out to the FBI,"" Blumenthal said.

CNN cannot independently verify the authenticity of the tape and has asked the FBI for confirmation of their interview with the man who made the recording.

The meaning of the pause

It's difficult to prove from the audio why the pause took place or whose narrative it supports.

Attorney Chris Chestnut said he was surprised by the gap in shots.

""It's the pause that gives most concern in a police shooting, especially with an unarmed victim, because at this point Mr. Brown is defenseless -- he has no weapon,"" said Chestnut, who represented the family of Jonathan Ferrell.

Like Brown, Ferrell was an unarmed African-American man who was shot and killed by a white police officer.

But if the gunfire heard on the audio is indeed from the Brown incident, the pause doesn't automatically suggest wrongful intent by the officer.

""To be fair, there could be other explanations for that pause,"" said attorney Van Jones, co-host of CNN's ""Crossfire."" ""Maybe the officer will say, 'Well, I fired and he kept advancing, so I fired again.' ""

Witnesses and a friend of Officer Darren Wilson have given conflicting accounts of what led up to Brown's death.

Dueling narratives in Michael Brown shooting

Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was walking with him at the time of the shooting, said the officer shot Brown once by the police car and again as he ran away.

According to Johnson, Brown was struck in the back and then turned around and put his arms up as the officer kept shooting.

But a friend of Wilson said Brown mocked the officer and charged at him before the shooting began.

An autopsy showed that all the entry wounds were in the front of Brown's body.

Will autopsy shed any light on what happened?

Key witness speaks out

Ferguson police said Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store shortly before the shooting.

And reports that his friend Johnson had a criminal record that includes lying to police has put Johnson's credibility in question.

In 2011, Johnson was arrested and accused of theft and lying to police about his first name, age and address.

Johnson said Monday night he doesn't understand why some are questioning his credibility.

""I see they bring up my past, my history, but it's not like it's a long rap sheet,"" Johnson told Lemon. ""This one incident shouldn't make me a bad person.""

"399","A religious cleric in Saudi Arabia has issued a fatwa ruling forbidding the building of snowmen.

Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid was asked whether it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for children after a snowstorm in the country's north. His response:
It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.

– SHEIKH MOHAMMED SALEH AL-MUNAJJID
Quoting Muslim scholars, he argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, which is considered sinful under the country's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

The ruling does open up the possibility of the building of a snowapple.
God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on.

– SHEIKH MUNAJJID
The fatwa comes after a number of social media users from Saudi Arabia have been posting images of snowmen and camels online, and has prompted lively debate. One user who appeared to take umbrage at the fatwa said:
A people looking for a fatwa for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa

– TWITTER USER
Whilst another praised the cleric for ""recognising matters even Satan does not think about"".
It is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism. May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognise matters that even Satan does not think about."
"401","Google Inc. plans to buy about half of Redwood City's mammoth Pacific Shores Center office campus in a stunning deal that could reshuffle the Peninsula real estate scene.

Even by the standards of Google’s relentless real-estate acquisition spree, this is a big one. The world's biggest search-engine company is buying six office buildings totaling nearly a million square feet, according to several industry sources who were not willing to talk about the deal publicly. The project is owned by the Blackstone Group and Starwood Capital and managed by Equity Office.

The purchase — which could close later this month — would be Mountain View-based Google’s most dramatic real estate move this year. It opens up another front in the search giant’s rapid Peninsula expansion after big deals in Palo Alto and Sunnyvale. And it provides a potential seaborne solution to increasingly gridlocked highways: Pacific Shores is spitting distance from the Port of Redwood City, where Google has been experimenting with commuter ferries as a way to reduce the demands on its extensive bus network.

Google declined to comment. Blackstone didn’t respond to a request for comment. I’m told the sale is close to being finalized, though it’s still possible the deal could still fall through. Google's deposit isn't yet non-refundable, a customary marker for a deal headed toward the finish line, a person familiar with the transaction said.

“If any deal is done by anyone, we’d welcome them to Redwood City,” Mayor Jeffrey Gee told me in a phone call on Friday, adding that he’d wait to comment on Google’s potential arrival until a deal is complete.

Brokers said the impact of the acquisition, if completed, would ripple through the commercial real estate market. Assuming Google intends to occupy the space, tenants currently in the buildings — which are more than 90 percent leased — would have to find new space as their leases end. And Google tends to grow wherever it puts down roots.

“It adds fuel to the fire for more spec buildings to start coming out of the ground, because there’s going to be that much more pressure on space demand,” said Tim Grant, a veteran Bay Area office broker with Avison Young in Foster City.

The deal would mark another sign of tech companies taking a shine to the north Peninsula, coming just weeks after Box Inc. agreed to lease a major office project in downtown Redwood City.

“This is one more thing,” Grant said. “We’ve always been thought of as, ‘Maybe, but I’d rather be in San Francisco or (southern) Silicon Valley.’ Suddenly, the middle maybe isn’t a bad place to be.”

Google is expected to buy Blackstone and Starwood’s buildings at 1200, 1300, 1600, 1700, 1800 and 1900 Seaport Blvd., which total 934,000 square feet and are home to tenants such as Zazzle Inc. and Rocket Fuel. Google is not buying 2000 and 2100 Seaport Blvd., the owner-occupied headquarters of Informatica Corp. Nor is Google buying 1400 and 1500 Seaport Blvd., which includes DreamWorks. Those buildings are owned by Shorenstein, which has been in contract for a while to sell them to San Francisco-based investor DivcoWest, according to sources and public records.

The price Google will pay was not immediately clear, but an observer estimated it at “substantially more” than the $525 per square foot that Informatica paid for the two buildings it bought in 2012.

One of the Valley’s marquee campuses, Pacific Shores was built by Jay Paul Co. in the early 2000s and broke new ground for its sleek design and swanky amenities including pools, a rock-climbing wall, day spa and baseball diamonds. It was one of the first major developments that showed multiple tech companies would share the same campus, and rose taller than the one- and two-story buildings that were the standard for tech. Starwood bought the campus in 2006 for about $833 million, and immediately sold Shorenstein its two buildings. Blackstone came into the picture after acquiring the junior debt on the property a couple of years ago.

A new owner could build even more office space there, city officials said. The entire campus contains about 1.7 million square feet of office space, and new zoning approved about a year ago could allow total build-out of up to 3 million square feet.

“All things considered, there's still quite a bit of room to put more structures out there,” said Sailesh Mehra, associate city planner for the city. “You could essentially double that entire office park, if you can you could park it.”

Google — which like many expanding tech companies is focused on reducing its car and shuttle trips as traffic worsens during the current boom — may be eyeing transit options beyond freeways. Pacific Shores is a half mile from the Port of Redwood City, where a Google pilot project earlier this year tested running ferries from San Francisco and Alameda to the port. The Water Emergency Transportation Authority, which administers the San Francisco Bay Ferry routes, has studied regular public ferry service to Redwood City, with a potential public terminal practically next door to Pacific Shores.

""I know they really liked the ferry and the concept. Their challenge was getting people off a boat and putting them on a bus to Mountain View, and that was taking 25 minutes,"" said Kevin Connolly, director of planning and development for WETA. ""This might be one way to address it.""

San Mateo County has about $22 million left in a sales-tax funded pot for ferry services in the county. A Redwood City terminal would cost about $15 million. But the county doesn't have ongoing operational funding, Connolly said.

A major built-in user such as Google could help make service pencil out, he said.

""If they're serious about doing it, we could do something, and there are lots of options,"" Connolly said. ""We could be very creative about working this out.""

If the deal is completed, it would probably take several years for Google to truly put its stamp on Redwood City. Tenants are in the buildings long term, and Google’s continued expansion elsewhere in Silicon Valley — it just leased another 424,000 square feet in Sunnyvale— means it’s probably not under immediate pressure to occupy the campus.

The current and future Google growth ""(is) going to impact the face of the Valley,"" Mark Bodie, a senior vice president with JLL who represents landlords, said on a market update call with media earlier this week,. ""It's really going to change the dynamics of what's available for lease.""

The world will remain, during these three days, without sunlight due to a solar storm, which will cause dust and space debris to become plentiful and thus, block 90% sunlight.

This is the head of NASA Charles Bolden who made the announcement and asked everyone to remain calm. This will be the product of a solar storm, the largest in the last 250 years for a period of 216 hours total. Reporters interviewed a few people to hear what they had to say about the situation with Michael Hearns responding “We gonna be purgin my n*gga, six days of darkness means six days of turnin up fam”.

Despite the six days of darkness soon to come, officials say that the earth will not experience any major problems, since six days of darkness is nowhere near enough to cause major damage to anything. “We will solely rely on artificial light for the six days, which is not a problem at all”, says NASA scientist Earl Godoy.

"405","Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary was known as 'L Jinny' as a rapper

Saturday 23 August 2014

A former rapper fighting with the Islamic State (Isis) in Syria is believed to be one of several British jihadists under investigation following the beheading of James Foley.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary, 24, was known as L Jinny or Lyricist Jinn at home in London, where his rising music career saw him appear in videos and have his singles played on BBC Radio in 2012.

He came to national attention earlier this year, when he posted a picture of himself holding a severed head on Twitter after resurfacing in Syria.

The gruesome picture, believed to have been taken in the Isis stronghold of Raqqa, was captioned: “Chillin’ with my homie or what’s left of him.”

Bary reportedly travelled to the country last year from Maida Vale, west London, where he lived with his mother and five siblings.

His father Adel Abdul Bary, an Egyptian refugee thought to be one of Osama Bin Laden’s closes lieutenants, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 for his alleged roles in the bombings of two US embassies in east Africa in 1998.

His family is frequently mentioned in rap songs that are still floating around the internet, with many people, unaware of L Jinny’s macabre transformation, praising his lyrics.

In early songs put online in 2012, Bary makes apparent reference to drug use, violence and life on a council estate and talks about the threat of his family being deported to Egypt.

“It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he rapped in 2012.

“I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there's funds in the bank.

“I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain't got normal feelings.

“Even my life’s blessed, still I will not find rest.”

In later songs, apparent references to cannabis (“roll up and watch the leaves ignite”) stop and are replaced with tirades against people who choose to spend their money clubbing, drinking and on drugs rather than feeding their families.

Many British jihadists are known to be in Syria, including these men featuring in an Isis video to urge Islamists in the West to join them  The most recent video, which was posted on YouTube in March this year, is called “The Beginning”.

“Give me the pride and the honour like my father, I swear the day they came and took my dad, I could have killed a cop or two,” Bary raps.

“Imagine then I was only six, picture what I’d do now with a loaded stick. Like boom bang fine, I’m wishing you were dead, violate my brothers and I’m filling you with lead.”

Bary’s current whereabouts in Syria is not known and his Twitter account under the name “Terrorist” @ItsLJinny has been deactivated.

Previous posts mentioned Abu Hussein al Britani, a fellow Isis militant who has uploaded pictures of himself on Twitter with guns in Syria.

He and associate Abu Abdullah al-Britani were seen offering travel advice to would-be jihadists online earlier this year.

The Sun newspaper has linked the trio to a group of British jihadists known as “The Beatles”, including the man known as “John” who beheaded American journalist Mr Foley.

In pictures: James Foley

A sound expert who compared the footage of the brutal killing with Bary’s rap songs told the paper there was a “big likeness” between the voices.

Mr Foley’s murderer has not been identified by authorities but the Foreign Secretary said he sounded British and experts were urgently trying to trace him.

Police are believed to be preparing for raids on several homes across Britain in efforts to trace “jihadi John” but a spokesperson for the Counter Terrorism Unit at Scotland Yard would not confirm the identities of any suspects."
"406","According to the latest research from our WDE (Wearables) research service, the Apple Watch smartwatch will ship 15 million units worldwide in 2015. Apple will quickly become the world’s number one smartwatch vendor with 55 percent global marketshare this year.

We forecast total global smartwatch shipments to grow 511 percent from 4.6 million units in 2014 to 28.1 million units in 2015. Most of the smartwatch growth will come from the new Apple Watch, which we forecast to ship 15.4 million units worldwide in 2015. Apple will quickly become the world’s number one smartwatch vendor and capture 55 percent global marketshare this year.

The Apple Watch is the catalyst to ignite the global smartwatch market. Apple’s famous brand, loyal fan base, deep retail presence and extensive apps ecosystem will ensure healthy uptake for its Watch. However, Apple’s first-generation Watch is not yet perfect. For example, Apple’s Watch hardware design is arguably less attractive than some rival models such as the Huawei Watch, battery life may not be as long as many traditional wristwatch owners are used to, and Apple’s premium pricing may be challenging for mass-market consumers. Apple will need to upgrade tangibly its second-generation Watch to stay ahead of competitors later this year."
"407","The health-focused smartwatch that Apple initially envisioned is not the same one the company will unveil next month, according to a new report.

Apple's original concept for the Apple Watch was one that would track blood pressure, heart activity, stress levels and other functions, the Wall Street Journal reported Monday, citing sources familiar with the device. But none of those features will make it into the final product due to a variety of issues, according to the Journal. Some features didn't work properly. Others proved too complex. And some would have required regulatory approval. As such, Apple was forced to scale back the range and depth of health features for its first entry into the smartwatch arena, the sources said.

Due out in April, the Apple Watch will enter an already crowded playing field, competing with products from Samsung, Sony, Motorola, Microsoft, LG and others. It's been thought that Apple postponed its release of a smartwatch at least in part to perfect the health and fitness monitoring features. But if the Journal's sources are correct, some of those features proved more challenging than expected.

For example, the Journal reported, Apple tested sensors to measure skin conductivity, which would have helped monitor stress levels and heart rate. But the sensors ran into inconsistencies with different people, such as those with hairy arms or dry skin, and the results were mixed based on how tightly you wore the watch, according to the Journal's sources.

Apple also tested ways to check blood pressure and the level of oxygen in the blood, but again, the results were inconsistent. Further, if those features strayed into the area of actually providing medical advice, they would have required approval from the Food and Drug Administration -- something Apple was trying to avoid.

The difficulties in creating a smartwatch with such features prompted people at Apple to dub the project a ""black hole"" as it sucked in more and more resources, one of the sources said.

As a result, Apple has been touting its first smartwatch as more of an all-purpose wearable. Yes, several key health and fitness features will be available and useful, especially as third-party developers create apps to tap into that market. But Apple is also busy promoting other aspects of the watch, including its variety of styles, its ability to act as an adjunct to the iPhone, its support for Apple Pay and its voice-activated controls.

Will those features and the Apple name convince enough consumers to consider the Apple Watch over the competition? In December, Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster projected unit sales of 8 million for 2015. Wall Street has been forecasting sales of 12 million to 15 million. Apple has reportedly asked its suppliers to manufacture 5 million to 6 million watches for its first quarter of release.

Whether initial sales are as healthy as expected, Apple will certainly come out with future models. Those could even include some of the health features that didn't pass muster the first time around, the Journal's sources added.

An Apple spokeswoman told CNET that the company declined to comment on rumor or speculation."
"409","Over the weekend, the Canadian police force of Newfoundland and Labrador posted a “wanted” status on Facebook looking for Rodney Constantine, a man wanted for assault and some outstanding warrants.

Apparently, Rodney Constantine himself commented on the post and is planning to turn himself in.

Constantine let police know he’ll be coming in “Monday morn,” but the RNC police politely reminded him that their facilities are open 24/7.

What proceeded was a weird and hilarious correspondence between police and Constantine in the comment section.

The RNC police told BuzzFeed News that they believe this is their guy, but he has yet to physically turn himself in.

“It’s hard to say if the person we found is the person, but it certainly seems that way,” Media Relations Officer Steve Curnew told BuzzFeed News.

Curnew also explained that they only turn to their social media outlets as a “last resort” if they can’t locate them by addresses on file. While police are hopeful they have the right Rodney Constantine, “no one by that name has turned themselves in yet.”

This is not the first or even second time a suspect has identified themselves to Newfoundland cops on Facebook.

Curnew says he’s not surprised Constantine has so casually commented on his own wanted post on Facebook — this has been the case at least twice before. “We’ve had it happen on one or two occasions that a person has contacted us,” Curnew explained to BuzzFeed News. “When you send it out on social media, word comes around quick.”

He also pointed out that Constantine might not have known he was even wanted.

“The person sometimes isn’t aware they have outstanding warrants. [He] may have just become aware that police are looking for him and he has nothing to hide.”

Meanwhile, Newfoundland residents still can’t quite get over it.

The Corsicana Daily Sun reported that local emergency management officials, the Corsicana-Navarro County Public Health District and county officials all say there’s no truth to the claim that federal officials closed down the town of about 130 residents.

""A release today on at least one website, National Report, stated that “The small town of Purdon, Texas has been quarantined after a family of five tested positive for the Ebola virus. This report is entirely false,” Navarro County Judge H.M. Davenport said in a statement.

""Local authorities, emergency management, and county government have been inundated with calls concerning this false report. Please be assured if this were accurate information, you would have been notified immediately from accurate sources first,” Davenport said.

""Please ensure that you utilize accurate information sources when looking on social media and any unknown news sources,” Davenport said."
"413","OK, so the robot apocalypse probably won’t happen any time soon, but the new robot sentries guarding Microsoft’s Silicon Valley campus seem like something straight out of a futuristic sci-fi movie.

According to ExtremeTech, each of the K5 security guard robots from robotics company Knightscope stands 5 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds, so you probably don’t want to mess with one.

The K5 robots don’t come with any weapons onboard—thankfully—but they use a suite of alarms, sirens, and cameras to monitor and patrol the grounds of Microsoft’s campus. If one spots trouble, it’ll either sound an alarm or dispatch a human security guard to its location. 

ExtremeTech notes that the K5 can run for up to 24 hours on a single charge, and can recharge in only about 20 minutes. Its battery won’t die out in the field, though—these bots will return to the charging station by themselves when their batteries start to run dry.

The story behind the story: Robots are playing an increasingly large role in security and military operations. Google-owned robotics company Boston Dynamics, for example, has been working with DARPA to develop various robots to aid soldiers in combat settings. Meanwhile, South Korea deployed a robotic sentry to guard its side of the Demilitarized Zone  in 2010. Unlike K5, though, South Korea’s guard robot came fully armed."
"414","While Apple has yet to publicly announce a specific launch date for the Apple Watch beyond ""Early 2015"", sources speaking to 9to5Mac say the company is currently planning for a March debut in the initial wave of countries. Sources in the retail segment indicate that select store employees will undergo centralized Apple Watch training the week of February 9, with those employees in turn training others at their individual stores in the days leading up to the device's launch.

One or two representatives from many Apple Stores in the United States, depending on store and market size, will be sent to Apple offices in either Cupertino, California or Austin, Texas to learn first-hand about the Watch. These training programs will take place between February 9th and February 16th.The report indicates Apple has been continuing to refine various aspects of the Apple Watch since its September unveiling, focusing mostly on software but also tweaking such components as the inductive charging mechanism.

Developers are currently working with Apple's WatchKit tools and iOS 8.2 betas to build apps for Apple Watch, starting with lightweight Glances, actionable notifications, and iPhone-based apps that project portions of their interfaces to the watch. More powerful apps running directly on the Apple Watch will be possible later this year.

"416","WASHINGTON (CBS DC) – Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., says that at least ten fighters for the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria have been apprehended while attempting to enter the southern U.S. border.
The California Republican claims that “at least ten ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” in a conversation with Fox News on Tuesday. Hunter says that the Islamic terrorists are slipping into the U.S. through the porous southern border as several have already been captured.
“There’s nobody talking about it,” Rep. Hunter told Fox. “If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border. It’s that simple…They caught them at the border, therefore we know that ISIS is coming across the border. If they catch five or ten of them then you know there’s going to be dozens more that did not get caught by the border patrol.”
In August, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin Dempsey, warned that the open border posed an “immediate threat” for terrorist activity infiltrating the country. The government watchdog group, Judicial Watch, said ISIS terrorists were “planning to attack the United States with car bombs or other vehicle born [sic] improvised explosive devices.”
Hunter, a member of the House Armed Services Committee, said that the 1,933-mile southern border with Mexico is the obvious entry point for Islamic State terrorists. He says that information regarding the capture of Islamic State terrorists crossing the border comes directly from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons. The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming through the southern border – which they already have,” he added.
“They aren’t flying B-1 bombers, bombing American cities,” said Hunter. “But they are going to be bombing American cities coming across from Mexico…All you have to do is ask the border patrol.”
The Department of Homeland Security released a statement on Wednesday that claims alleging Islamic State militants have been apprehended at the Mexican border are “categorically false.”
“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the Southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” a DHS spokesman said in a statement today. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”
After Hunter’s comments to Fox, one of his sources nuanced their claims, saying that some of those apprehended at the border might be ISIS-affiliated or possibly Americans who fought with the Syrian Free Army – one of many ISIS enemies.
In a statement to ABC News, a spokesperson for Hunter said he was not backing down on the claims.
“The Congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told,” the spokesperson told ABC. “It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

"417","A prominent Saudi Arabian cleric has whipped up controversy by issuing a religious ruling forbidding the building of snowmen, described them as anti-Islamic.

Asked on a religious website if it was permissible for fathers to build snowmen for their children after a snowstorm in the country's north, Sheikh Mohammed Saleh al-Munajjid replied: “It is not permitted to make a statue out of snow, even by way of play and fun.”

Quoting from Muslim scholars, Sheikh Munajjid argued that to build a snowman was to create an image of a human being, an action considered sinful under the kingdom's strict interpretation of Sunni Islam.

“God has given people space to make whatever they want which does not have a soul, including trees, ships, fruits, buildings and so on,” he wrote in his ruling.

That provoked swift responses from Twitter users writing in Arabic and identifying themselves with Arab names.

“They are afraid for their faith of everything ... sick minds,” one Twitter user wrote.

Another posted a photo of a man in formal Arab garb holding the arm of a “snow bride” wearing a bra and lipstick. “The reason for the ban is fear of sedition,” he wrote.

A third said the country was plagued by two types of people: “A people looking for a fatwa (religious ruling) for everything in their lives, and a cleric who wants to interfere in everything in the lives of others through a fatwa,” the user wrote.

Sheikh Munajjid had some supporters, however. “It (building snowmen) is imitating the infidels, it promotes lustiness and eroticism,” one wrote.

“May God preserve the scholars, for they enjoy sharp vision and recognize matters that even Satan does not think about.”

Snow has covered upland areas of Tabuk province near Saudi Arabia's border with Jordan for the third consecutive year as cold weather swept across the Middle East.

"418","VENICE BEACH, Calif. --You've probably heard Apple is launching its latest i-device, a new Apple Watch, in April and that it will start at $350.

But did you know there are three editions of the watch? What no one knows, outside of Apple, is how much the top of the line ""Watch Edition"" will sell for.

We've seen online reports that it could sell for as much as $4,000. Maybe more.

So we got to wondering: How much would consumers pay for the top-of-the-line Apple Watch?

Not much, as we recently found out in chats with consumers here.

""I'd get the $350 model,"" says Ashlea Fellows of Australia. ""I wouldn't go any higher.""

Thousands of dollars for a gold watch? Not for Karla Gallegos of Chile. ""Too expensive. I could find a watch made of gold for $2,000,"" she said.

Juan Frias of New York would drop $1,000. ""I like gold watches,"" he says. ""I'm a teacher, and I wouldn't have to look down at my wrist. My daughter texts me, I can look and nobody can say, `Hey, you're on the phone.'""

Apple touts the high-end Apple Watch as sporting a 18-karat gold case, which it says is twice as hard as standard gold. And it's protected by sapphire crystal, advertised as almost impossible to break, unlike the gorilla glass of the iPhone.

In mid-2014, many analysts expected Apple to use sapphire glass on the iPhone 6, but that didn't happen. Apple wasn't happy with the sapphire being produced by its factory near Phoenix, which has since been shut down. The company hasn't said where its new sapphire is being produced.

Estimates online for how much Apple will charge for the top-line watch are all over the map. Website Grail-watch.com goes as high as $10,000. ""t's pretty much impossible to find a gold watch for under $10,000 in any size,"" notes the site.

But even at $4,000 or $5,000, the price tag will make it easily the most expensive item at the Apple Store. It's most expensive computer, the MacPro, starts at around $3,000.

Apple's high-priced watch will be in good company -- and even if it tops the most optimistic estimates, it will be still be way cheaper than the gold standard of luxury watches, the Rolex. Amazon's Rolex page starts at $4,000 and goes all the way up to $62,000.

But those watches don't read back texts or control your music.

With such expensive i-jewelry on display at shopping malls across the world, will it change the way people shop at the Apple Store? Will folks be wary of walking out of the store with a multi-thousand-dollar gold watch on their wrists?

Paul Wallace of Long Beach, Calif., admits that sporting a gold Apple watch on his wrist would make him a target. ""It would….but you've got to go Gold,"" he said. ""If you've got it, flaunt it.""

"423","The reported ceasefire between the Nigerian government and Boko Haram, the terrorist group still holding more than 200 girls captive, does not appear to be working out, as violence over the weekend put the possibility of the girls' return on even more tenuous ground.

As Reuters reports, while the Nigeria's Air Chief Marshal Alex Badeh announced the deal last Friday, it was not confirmed by Boko Haram. At least five attacks have occurred since the announcement.

From CNN:

In one attack, militants ambushed travelers in the Borno state village of Shaffa, residents of the area said, killing eight people and abducting others.

Boko Haram gunmen also stormed the village of Waga in Adamawa state, abducting a number of residents, including women, residents there told CNN.

Insurgents also occupied the town of Abadam, near Niger, after killing an unknown number of residents in their attack, residents said.

According to Reuters, negotiations between the government and the insurgency are expected to continue in Chad on Monday, but family members of those kidnapped are skeptical of whether they will be productive.

"424","Apple has remained mum as to its pricing strategy for the three versions of the Apple Watch to be made available next year, only saying that the price will start at $350 for the entry-level version, likely to be the Apple Watch Sport, which features light aluminum and a sweat-resistant band made from a rubbery material.

But jewelry industry experts believe the Apple Watch Edition, which comes with 18-karat yellow gold or rose gold, a sapphire crystal display and Venetian leather for its bands, will cost around $1,200, with other jewelers estimating that Apple's fanciest smartwatch could be priced as much as $10,000.

Watch expert Chad Rickicki of Pittsburgh, Penn. told TechCrunch that an 18-karat gold case that is the size and shape of the Apple Watch could rack up as much as $600 for the raw material. That does not even include the smartwatch's electronic components and the profit margin Apple plans to tack on to the device. All in all, consumers can expect to pay $1,200 for a gold smartwatch, says Rickicki.

However, other jewelers are not as optimistic, saying that we need to understand the materials Apple used for its smartwatch to be able to peg it at a more accurate price. Ariel Adams, founder and editor of watch blog aBlogtoWatch, says Apple adopted watch industry terminology for the Apple Watch. The term ""18-karat gold,"" he says, likely means the watch is made of solid gold, not gold-plated. Otherwise, Apple would have used the term ""gold-plated.""

The current market price for gold is $1,200 per ounce. If, for example, the Apple Watch weighs two ounces, that is already $2,400 just for the gold. That is not even considering the special process Apple's own metallurgists invented to create gold that is ""twice as hard as standard gold."" Adams says Apple has cheaper manufacturing centers in China than the facilities used by Swiss-based watchmakers, but gold is gold and it is expensive wherever it is crafted.

Adams also points out that there is also the cost of sapphire glass to contend with, estimating that Apple has to pay around $30 to $40 for the sapphire crystal case of the Edition smart watch. Sapphire manufacturing, Adams says, is a long and expensive process where the crystals are synthetically grown in large chambers and then cut into rectangles that are then laminated. Adams thinks the high-end Apple Watch will not cost anything less than $5,000 and could go up as much as $10,000.

""The Edition is going to be far, far less mass-produced than the steel version,"" he says. ""I think it's going to have a much different type of distribution. It'll be a much more exclusive product."""
"425","Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) said Tuesday night that U.S. border officials have caught “at least 10″ Islamic State fighters or people with ties to the group as they tried to enter the U.S. through Mexico, a claim that was immediately disputed by the Obama administration.

“I know that at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas,” Hunter said on Fox News Tuesday night. “There’s nobody talking about it.”

When asked by host Greta Van Susteren how he knows this, Hunter said, “Because I’ve asked the Border Patrol, Greta.”

The Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman disputed Hunter’s claim on Wednesday morning.

“The suggestion that individuals who have ties to ISIL have been apprehended at the southwest border is categorically false, and not supported by any credible intelligence or the facts on the ground,” said Marsha Catron. “DHS continues to have no credible intelligence to suggest terrorist organizations are actively plotting to cross the southwest border.”

But Hunter’s office replied by saying Hunter was told directly by a senior official that people with ties to the Islamic State have in fact been apprehended.

“A high level source within the Border Patrol told the congressman otherwise,” said Hunter spokesman Joe Kasper. “The congressman was conveying what he knows — and what he was told. It makes sense that the left hand of DHS doesn’t know what the right hand is doing — it’s been that way for a long time and we don’t expect that to change.”

Hunter said Tuesday that the biggest risk that the Islamic State poses to Americans is by trying to enter the U.S. illegally and committing acts of terrorism.

“If you really want to protect Americans from ISIS, you secure the southern border,” he said. “It’s that simple.”

“ISIS doesn’t have a navy, they don’t have an air force, they don’t have nuclear weapons,” he added. “The only way that ISIS is going to harm Americans is by coming in through the southern border, which they already have.”

The Obama administration has come under increased scrutiny about border enforcement in light of fears that Islamic State fighters could try to enter the U.S. through Mexico. Officials were already under fire for its effort to ease immigration rules, which many Republicans say has created even more incentive for people to try entering the country illegally.

Bale is apparently in final talks to take on the role of Jobs, according to film industry publication Variety, which believes the casting is essentially a done deal. Bale will be directed by Danny Boyle, who won an Oscar for Best Director in 2008 for the film ""Slumdog Millionaire.""

The two are working from a script by Aaron Sorkin, who himself won an Oscar in 2011 for penning ""The Social Network."" The film is expected to be loosely based on Walter Isaacson's official Jobs biography.

There has been some turmoil behind the scenes on the project, as director David Fincher was previously attached, but reportedly walked away after making demands of $10 million in up front payment and full control over marketing. Sony, which is responsible for the film, was apparently reluctant to make that commitment after a marketing debacle with Fincher's adaptation of ""The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.""

Bale won an Oscar in 2011 for Best Supporting Actor for his performance in ""The Fighter."" He was also nominated last year for Best Actor for ""American Hustle,"" but is perhaps best known for playing Batman in Christopher Nolan's ""Dark Knight"" trilogy."
"431","Tiger Woods isn't golfing. He's taking some time off to rest, to heal, and to work on his game. But according to one dude who probably doesn't know anything, it's all a coverup, and Woods is actually serving a secret Tour suspension for a failed drug test. Today, both the PGA Tour and Woods's agent flatly deny the claim.

The drug-test rumor came from occasional pro golfer Dan Olsen, and was made on a Lansing, Mich., sports talk radio show on Friday morning. Who the hell is Dan Olsen? Good question! He played a single full season on Tour in 2004, hasn't played a PGA event since 2011, and now mostly caddies and gives lessons. But he had this to say:

""I've heard that he's suspended. I heard he's on a month's suspension. And it's not, it's kind of a strong witness. It's a credible person that's telling me this. It's not testosterone, but it's something else. I think when it's all said and done, he's gonna surpass Lance Armstrong with infamy.""
That's a strong allegation to make, and Olsen had better be able to back it up. (He's not, but more on that in a bit.) Today, the PGA Tour said it's all horseshit.

""There is no truth whatsoever to these claims. We categorically deny these allegations,"" said Ty Votaw, executive vice president of the PGA Tour.
Woods's agent, too:

""These claims are absolutely, unequivocally and completely false,"" agent Mark Steinberg said. ""They are unsourced, unverified and completely ridiculous.""
Olsen is walking back everything he said, telling ESPN.com his Friday comments were ""only my opinion and not based on any first-hand knowledge or facts."" Which is a claim that relies on a pretty loose definition of the word ""opinion.""

Olsen went on to say that ""I'll be looked at as just some crazy fucking nobody making accusations about Tiger,"" and it might have been the first true thing he's said in four days."

Police were informed about the first attack by witnesses – but have yet to trace the victim.

The force have now asked for anyone with any information about, or who witnessed, the two related incidents to contact them.

Sgt Gill Cherry from said: 'We are treating these two reported incidents as linked, and are appealing to the local community to help trace the man responsible.

'It is very unusual behaviour, and will have left his victims feeling confused and upset.'

She had been taken into the hospital and had given birth, and then placed in a ward where attempts had been made to contact her family as she was left to nurse the child.

However on the woman's third day in hospital, nurse Liu Tianlun had gone into the bedroom to find the young mother biting her son on the arm. When the nurse raised the alarm and tried to pull the baby free, the mother had refused to let go and continued to bite the tiny limb.

A hospital spokesman said: ""It was really shocking, the arm was badly damaged and suffered not only heavy bruising but bleeding as a result of the bite. Fortunately, doctors managed to insert something to stop her closing her teeth and then levered her jaws apart. After that they gave her a sedative and took the baby to a secure location.""

She had apparently survived on the streets for at the very least several weeks and possibly longer before she was spotted in labour and the alarm was raised.

A graphic video obtained by NBC News purportedly shows James Wright Foley, a freelance reporter for the U.S.-based news service GlobalPost who was kidnapped while reporting from Syria two years ago, reciting threats against America before he is executed by an ISIS militant.

Foley was kidnapped at gunpoint near the town of Taftanaz in northern Syria on Thanksgiving Day in 2012. He had not been heard from during his time in captivity. ""We’ve heard nothing. Nothing. We last knew that he was abducted on Thanksgiving Day in the Idlib province, but we don’t know who took him or why,"" Foley's father, John, said on TODAY last year.

Foley traveled extensively in the Middle East and North Africa. He reported about conflicts from Iraq, Afghanistan, and Libya, where he was once held captive for 44 days.

In May 2011, Foley recorded a video interview with The Boston Globe about his arrest and captivity in Libya. “You don’t want to be defined as that guy who got captured in 2011,” he said. “I believe that front-line journalism is important.”

The woman, who is known only as Lana, describes herself as a feminist who has fought for women’s rights “to the point of eschewing a career”.

She wrote that when she found out she was pregnant in 2012 she was overjoyed until she realised it was a boy.

“I was in shock, I started crying, weeping at the thought of what I was about to curse the world with.

“Crying, sobbing, uncontrollable weeping, mental anguish the likes of which may only be experienced by those who have had their lives destroyed by war, I was a refugee, and my home was my refugee camp, an unfamiliar place that was just… sheltering me.”

After three days of mourning about the idea of bringing a “monster” into the world, she decided to go to an abortion clinic and have the foetus removed.

She said: “I don’t hate men, I hate the patriarchy, what men, and even some women, turn into, I wasn’t going to let that happen with my offspring. The chances were greater that it would with a male, it was unacceptable.

“If the curse returns, I would do the exact same thing all over again.”

She wrote that during her experiences of fighting for women’s rights, she found that “men generally would look down on us, refuse to help us, or hardly even lend an ear so that we could air our grievances”.

“This didn’t surprise me, the patriarchy has been well entrenched since the dawn of time, but here I was, here I am, ready to change it,” she wrote.

Lana’s blog post has since received much criticism, with people calling her a “mentally ill female”, and writing messages such as: “Her mother already brought a monster into the word by giving birth to HER!”

On her blog Lana wrote that she had lost many friends and family members over the last three years, and responded to the criticism she had received.

“I cannot believe some of the emails that have been forwarded to me, do people really exist who want to see me dead because of what I chose to do with my own body?,” she wrote.

“The thing that I hope everyone takes away from all of this is that I own the reasons why I chose to have an abortion. Most of you reading probably have no idea what it is like to go through the process of debating whether or not to abort a pregnancy, let alone the actual experience of it.

“To me, the experience was liberating, the emotions I felt when deciding what I should do, and after learning my foetus was male was something I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. Coming out of it a liberated woman though was more than worth it.”

Abortion based on gender is already illegal here in the UK, but MPs have been fighting to clarify the amendment to the 1967 Abortion Act that states this.

The amendment reads: ""Nothing in section 1 of the Abortion Act 1967 can be interpreted as allowing a pregnancy to be terminated on the grounds of the sex of the unborn child.""

A Telegraph investigation found that gender-based abortion does still take place in the UK, with some cultures favouring boys over girls."
"450","TEXAS CITY — A local plumber is being flooded with phone calls — and some threats — after a picture of one of his old company vehicles being used by Islamist militants in Syria was posted on Twitter.
The picture was posted online by the Islamic extremist brigade Ansar al-Deen Front, according to a CBS News report. It shows a black pick-up truck with a Mark-1 Plumbing decal on the door and an anti-aircraft gun in the bed.
Mark Oberholtzer, who has owned and operated Mark-1 Plumbing in Texas City for the past 32 years, confirmed it was his pickup truck in the picture. He said he no longer owned the vehicle and had no idea how it ended up in Syria.
Oberholtzer said he traded in the truck to an AutoNation dealership three years ago. He usually takes the decals off his vehicles when he sells them but he left it on this truck with the expectation that AutoNation would remove it.
“They were supposed to have done it and it looks like they didn’t do it,” Oberholtzer said. “How it ended up in Syria, I’ll never know.”
He began receiving calls about the truck and the picture on Monday afternoon, Oberholtzer said. By Tuesday he said his business had received a thousand calls and faxes about the image.
“A few of the people are really ugly,” he said.
Derek Duckett, emergency management coordinator for Texas City, said he was unaware of any threats but was checking with local police to reach out to Mark 1 to see whether it needed assistance.
Oberholtzer said he didn’t know what to do about all the attention he was getting from the picture. He just wanted the public to know that the vehicle was no longer his.
“I just want it to go away, to tell you the truth,” he said."
"451","Comcast, the cable company widely applauded for its outstanding customer service, has unfairly come under fire for its totally reasonable reaction to a customer's complaint.

According to the Consumerist, a customer identified as ""Conal"" claims he was fired from the accounting firm where he worked after a Comcast rep called his boss and told on him for trying to report his terrible customer service experience to Comcast higher-ups.

The story starts as most Comcast stories start: with the cable company charging Conal for services and equipment he neither requested nor used. When Conal tried to cancel his subscription in October 2013, Comcast reportedly sent him $1,820 worth of equipment he didn't request — stuff like modems, DVRs, etc. — and charged him for it. When Conal created an itemized spreadsheet and took it to the Comcast customer-service reps to show them the overcharges, they refused to acknowledge the mistake.

So Conal decided to escalate the issue to the company's controller, but when he spoke to someone in the office there, she was equally unhelpful. No one ever sorted out Conal's customer-service request.

This, Conal claims, is where it gets messy. The accounting firm where he worked reportedly fired him after someone from Comcast contacted his employer to say Conal had called to express his displeasure with Comcast. The call kicked off an ethics investigation that led to Conal's firing.

According to the Consumerist:

Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller’s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

Plus, though his company consulted with Comcast, Conal argues that bringing their name up wouldn't have helped his situation in the first place.

Comcast: still the worst."
"454","It was less than two weeks ago that screenwriter Aaron Sorkin was gushing over Christian Bale as the best actor on the board in a certain age range” and his ideal choice to play Apple founder Steve Jobs in a new biopic. He said he “couldn’t be more excited” to have cast him in the role. Now, according to The Hollywood Reporter, Bale has dropped out of the project.

Sources told THR that “after much deliberation and conflicting feelings” Bale “came to the conclusion he was not right for the part and decided to withdraw.” Before Bale was given the chance to turn down the role, it was reportedly offered to Leonardo DiCaprio, who also declined.

Meanwhile, it was reported last week that Seth Rogen is set to play Jobs’ co-founder Steve Wozniak. But without a signed deal with producer Scott Rudin, that casting could definitely change as well.

With Bale and DiCaprio out of the picture, what appropriately-aged, Oscar-calibar actor who looks enough like Steve Jobs could be left? And whatever you do, don’t say Ashton Kutcher.

"455","Questions surrounded purported deal between Nigerian government and Boko Haram for release of missing schoolgirls

The Nigerian government says it has agreed a ceasefire with the Islamist militant group Boko Haram and is negotiating for the release of 219 schoolgirls kidnapped six months ago.

The deal would mark a huge breakthrough after a five-year insurgency by extremists seeking to create an Islamic state in the north of Africa’s most populous country. It has left thousands dead and a worldwide outcry was prompted when the girls were abducted in April from the north-eastern town of Chibok.

Members of the Bring Back Our Girls campaign tweeted: “We are monitoring the news with huge expectations.”

But questions surrounded the purported agreement on Friday. Similar claims from the government and military have failed to bear fruit. The Nigerian president, Goodluck Jonathan, is expected to declare that he is standing for re-election, and positive news about the hostages and insurgency could deflect criticism of his handling of the crisis.

Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, told a press conference in the capital, Abuja: “Already, the terrorists have announced a ceasefire in furtherance of their desire for peace. In this regard, the government of Nigeria has, in similar vein, declared a ceasefire.”

Omeri claimed that there had been direct negotiations this week about the release of the missing girls. Boko Haram negotiators “assured that the schoolgirls and all other people in their captivity are all alive and well”, he said.

The truce was announced on Friday by Nigeria’s chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, who ordered his troops to comply immediately with the agreement. Boko Haram has not made a public statement.

The group had been demanding the release of detained extremists in exchange for the girls. Jonathan had said he could not countenance a prisoner swap.

The failure of Jonathan’s government to rescue the girls has prompted an international campaign and daily Bring Back Our Girls rallies in Abuja to highlight the girls’ plight. There was further anger when posters calling for Jonathan’s re-election in February by using the hashtag BringBackGoodluck2015 appeared until he ordered them to be torn down.

In July, Jonathan met for the first time parents of the girls and dozens of classmates who managed to escape. It followed months of controversy in which the parents had sought a meeting. He finally agreed to the meeting after a request from Malala Yousafzai, the 17-year-old Pakistani schoolgirl who was shot by Taliban militants in 2012 and won the Nobel peace prize this month for her campaigning for girls’ right to an education.

Jonathan’s principal secretary, Hassan Tukur, told Agence France-Presse on Friday that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as a deal to release the 219 girls.

Tukur said he had represented the government at two meetings with the Islamist extremists in neighbouring Chad, mediated by that country’s president, Idriss Déby. “Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,” said Tukur. “They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,” he added.

But there was uncertainty about the identity of Boko Haram’s representative at the talks, named by Tukur as Danladi Ahmadu.

Multiple analysts cast doubt on Ahmadu’s credibility as a Boko Haram envoy. Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP: “I have never heard of such a man, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire, it would come from the group’s leader, Abubakar Shekau.”

Ralph Bello-Fadile, an assistant to Nigeria’s national security adviser (NSA), told a conference on Monday that it had been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau. “Government wants to negotiate, but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau,” he told a Chatham House event in Abuja.

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday yesterday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group’s chief security officer and in charge of publicity. He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means “western education is forbidden”. The name was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders – the insurgents themselves never use the term. Their leaders have exclusively used the name Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati wal-Jihad, which means “People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet’s Teachings and Jihad”.

Boko Haram stormed the school in Chibok in April and snatched nearly 300 students, of whom 219 remain in captivity. This week about 50 protesters in red shirts tried to march to the presidential villa but were repeatedly diverted by riot police. The president has blamed activists for politicising the abductions and influencing the parents."
"456","Editors' note: There are images in this post that some readers may find distressing.

Islamic State militants on Tuesday released a video that purported to show the beheading of James Foley, an American freelance journalist who has been missing since he was kidnapped in Syria in November 2012.

The authenticity of the video could not be immediately verified.

When contacted by Mashable, NSC spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said, “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

The video opens with a clip of President Barack Obama's remarks announcing the launch of airstrikes on Islamic State positions near Erbil in northern Iraq. A black screen then shows the text, ""A message to America,"" and then Foley appears kneeling in a desert landscape, wearing an orange jumpsuit with a microphone attached. A hooded man wearing all-black clothes and tan military boots is standing behind him with a gun in a leather holster.

""I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government, for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,"" Foley says, among other things, in remarks seemingly prepared for him by his captors.

The video then switches to the man in black, who is now holding a serrated knife.

""This is James Wright Foley — an American citizen of your country,"" the man says in British-accented English. ""As a government, you have been at the forefront of the aggression towards Islamic State.... Effectively, any aggression towards the Islamic State is an aggression towards Muslims from all walks of life who have accepted the Islamic Caliphate as their leadership. So any attempt by you, Obama, to deny the safety of Muslims living under the safety of the Islamic Caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

The man then beheads Foley, using the knife as the video fades to black. After a shot of Foley's lifeless body and decapitated head, the video switches to the executioner now standing behind another man in an orange jumpsuit, identified in text on the screen as Steven Joel Sotloff.

""The life of this American prisoner, Obama, depends on your next decision.""

Sotloff, an American freelance journalist who had been working for Time magazine among other publications, was kidnapped near the Syrian-Turkish border on Aug. 4, 2013.

The video then goes black.

The video was first reported by Zaid Benjamin, a reporter for the Arabic-language Radio Sawa, who said that it came from Furqan Media, the official outlet for the Islamic State. (Twitter suspended — then reinstated — the account.)

The video appeared to surface first on the Twitter account @mujahid4life, belonging to someone who described himself in his Twitter bio as 19 years old, ""anti-democracy. Loyal to the Caliphate. Harsh on kuffar. #Revert""

It didn't take long before people who had worked with Foley began reacting on Twitter.

I was w/ James Foley in Aleppo, August 2012 for a day in #Selahaddin. Syrian opposition members were adoring him. He was a kind, brave man

My thoughts are with James Foley’s family. No matter what he faced, he was unfailingly kind, generous, and warm. A wonderful soul.

— Max Fisher (@Max_Fisher) August 19, 2014

There was also anger on Twitter that YouTube didn't immediately take down the video.

It's lucky that video didn't have a unlicensed Katy Perry song as a soundtrack or it would've been deleted from YouTube in seconds.

— Tom Gara (@tomgara) August 19, 2014

However, within an hour of the first report of the beheading, the video was taken down.

Images from the video are below, showing Foley before his execution and Sotloff being threatened:

Shortly after the clip appeared on the web, journalists and observers who watch the region began tweeting a hashtag — #ISISmediaBlackout — pledging to stop sharing Islamic State propaganda.

""You know what I think? And I know how crazy this sounds, but we need an #ISISmediaBlackout. Amputate their reach. Pour water on their flame,"" said a Tumblr blogger known as LibyaLiberty on Twitter in what appeared to be the first mention of the hashtag. ""From here on out, I won't share any photo or video of violence intentionally recorded & released by ISIS for propaganda,"" she tweeted. Many others, promptly, joined her pledge.

A statement from a group called Free James Foley said: ""We know that many of you are looking for confirmation or answers. Please be patient until we all have more information, and keep the Foleys in your thoughts and prayers.""

Post by Free James Foley.

Foley's parents appeared on the Today show last year, pleading for his release.

UPDATED 8:28 p.m. ET: GlobalPost CEO Philip Balboni released a statement Tuesday about the video that purportedly shows the beheading of journalist James Foley.

""On behalf of John and Diane Foley, and also GlobalPost, we deeply appreciate all of the messages of sympathy and support that have poured in since the news of Jim’s possible execution first broke. We have been informed that the FBI is in the process of evaluating the video posted by the Islamic State to determine if it is authentic,"" Balboni said.

“Although GlobalPost’s investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic rebels in Syria,"" he added. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.”

Foley reported in Syria for GlobalPost as a freelancer.

"458","British actor poised to take the lead in Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle, after Leonardo DiCaprio pulled out

Christian Bale is back in line to play Steve Jobs in a new biopic about the Apple co-founder after Leonardo DiCaprio backed out in order to take a break from acting.

The film industry magazine Variety reports that Bale will take the lead in the film Jobs, directed by Danny Boyle and written by Aaron Sorkin, scriptwriter of The Social Network and The West Wing.

Based on Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs: the Exclusive Biography, the film will be divided into three long scenes taking place in real time, each set on the eve of a product launch. Sorkin has revealed that the products are the Mac in 1984; the NeXT computer Jobs launched in 1990 after leaving Apple; and the iPod, which launched 2001.

David Fincher had originally been announced as the film’s director, but left the project after an argument with Sony about his salary and the marketing of the film. Bale had been Fincher’s first choice to play Jobs.

Bale and Boyle are set to shoot the film in spring 2015. Sorkin said that writing a film about Jobs “is a little like writing about the Beatles. There are so many people out there that know him and revere him.”"

Duncan, the first person in the U.S. to become sick with virus, died Wednesday. “It is with profound sadness and heartfelt disappointment that we must inform you of the death of Thomas Eric Duncan,” said a statement from Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital, where he was being treated. “He fought courageously in this battle.”

"461","Fourteen more police arrested as forensic investigators find no trace of students missing since violent confrontation in Guerrero

Authorities testing remains found in nine mass graves in southern Mexico say they are yet to find any trace of 43 students who disappeared after a confrontation with police.

None was among 28 bodies, some badly burned, that were unearthed a week after the 26 September attack, said the attorney general, Jesús Murillo Karam.

Forensic investigators continued to test other remains and announced the discovery of a 10th mass grave on Tuesday. An additional 14 police officers had been arrested and confessed to participating in the disappearance, Karam said, bringing the total number of detainees to 50.

The 14 are from the police force of Cocula, a town neighbouring Iguala, where the confrontation took place in the southern state of Guerrero. Both the mayor and police chief of Iguala are fugitives and accused of links to the local drug cartel, Guerrero Unidos, believed to have worked with police in taking the students. The gang controls drug routes in Guerrero and Morelos states.

Karam said officials had yet to identify the masterminds or a motive in the attack but the collusion might have gone beyond just one town. “There’s a connection. We will determine if it was coordination or subordination, but it’s clear to me that they were working together,” he said of police and drug traffickers in the area.

Police opened fire on about 100 teaching college students who had hijacked buses to return to campus after arriving in Iguala

Six people were killed, 25 wounded and dozens of students rounded up by police. There has been no sign of the missing in nearly three weeks, despite investigators combing the clandestine burial sites outside Iguala, where drug cartels are believed to dump their enemies.

On Tuesday, the Guerrero governor, Angel Aguirre, said many of the bodies at the first site appeared to have been buried for some time, suggesting they belonged to earlier victims of criminal gangs.

“Some of them are not recent, some are from months ago,” Aguirre told MVS radio.

One forensic expert, who works with federal investigators, said identification was an arduous, time-consuming process. Charred remains like those recovered at the first mass graves could leave very little DNA for testing.

Hundreds of teachers, students and relatives of the missing marched peacefully to the centre of the state capital, Chilpancingo, on Tuesday after a night of angry protests and vandalism that badly damaged the state capital building.

They lined up in silence as organisers handed out white flowers. Some carried candles with a sprawling billboard offering a 1m peso (£47,000) reward for information.

On Monday, protesters demanding to know the whereabouts of the missing smashed windows at the state capital building complex in Chilpancingo, 132 miles south of Mexico City, and set fire to buildings."
"462","Throughout the three-plus years of the Syrian civil war, one oft-sung refrain among some American officials has been that arming Syrian moderates (whoever they may be) is a dicey proposition because the weapons ""could fall into the wrong hands.""

Despite these objections, the United States eventually sent military aid to the Free Syrian Army last year. The policy change was precipitated by Syrian dictator Bashar Assad's violation of the Obama administration's ""red line"" after the regime used chemical weapons against civilians.

Last month, with the rise of ISIS in mind, Congress approved the president's plan to to train and arm the Syrian rebels. There was some familiar dissent at the time. ""How will we ensure that the United States weapons we are providing to Syrian rebels will not get into the wrong hands, as they did with the rebels we supported in Libya?"" Representative Barbara Lee asked.

On the same day as that vote, Islamic State fighters first encircled Kobani, a Syrian town near the Turkish border, attacking the largely Kurdish town and inspiring vigorous American airstrikes. On Monday, hoping to decisively turn the tide in the battle, the United States airdropped weapons to the Syrian Kurds of Kobani. By way of explanation, especially to a skeptical Turkish audience, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry offered that not aiding the Kurds in their fight against ISIS is both ""irresponsible"" and ""morally very difficult.""

Unfortunately, with that one airdrop, the weight of the American dread about where its weapons might go also landed. According to the Associated Press, some of the weapons meant to reach the Kurds ended up in Islamic State hands instead.

The cache of weapons included hand grenades, ammunition and rocket-propelled grenade launchers, according to a video uploaded by a media group loyal to the Islamic State.
The Associated Press said the video was consistent with other reporting. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, British activist group, added that more than one cache of weapons might have been snatched up by Islamic State fighters.

Of course, this wouldn't be the first time that Islamic State fighters have captured American weapons. This might just have been the easiest."

"467","Crews removed a time capsule dating back to 1795 on Thursday from the granite cornerstone of the Massachusetts Statehouse, where historians believe it was originally placed by Revolutionary War luminaries Samuel Adams and Paul Revere among others.

The small time capsule is believed to contain items such as old coins, documents, newspapers and a metal plate that was owned by Revere.

Secretary of State William Galvin speculated that some of the items could have deteriorated over time.

Official plan to X-ray the capsule on Sunday at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts to get some idea of the contents and possibly details on their condition, then open it next week.

Originally made of cowhide, the time capsule was believed to have been embedded in the cornerstone when construction on the state Capitol began in 1795. Adams was governor of Massachusetts at the time.

The time capsule was removed in the mid-19th century and its contents transferred to a copper box, Galvin said. Its removal Thursday was due to an ongoing water filtration project at the building. Galvin said the plan is to return it to the site sometime next year.

Pamela Hatchfield, a conservator at the museum, was exhausted Thursday after spending hours chiseling and drilling on the massive cornerstone, taking care not to damage the time capsule or coins that were thrown in the mortar that held it in place.

She held up the capsule for viewing by state officials, reporters and contractors involved in the renovation of the Statehouse.

'It's heavy,' Hatchfield said. 'I feel happy and relieved and excited and really interested to see what's in this box.'

Hatchfield said state officials did not know that the time capsule was embedded in the cornerstone until 60 years after some of the nation's leading founding political figures put it there.

'It was first put in there in 1795 by Paul Revere and Sam Adams and was unearthed accidentally when in 1855 there were some amendments to the building,' Hatchfield said. 'They put the contents back into a new box and placed it in a depression in the stone, which is on the underside.'

Galvin said there were notes from 1855 indicating that officials washed some of the contents in the capsule with acid before putting them in the new copper box.

It also was a humid day when the items were restored and, Galvin said, the corner of the Statehouse where the capsule was fixed has had a water leakage problem for 30 years.

'We have to see what held up since that time,' he said. 'That's the biggest question we have right now — are the contents in good condition or not?'

Galvin said the Massachusetts Statehouse is one of the oldest, active statehouses in the country.

'Obviously, when we talk about the original box being presided over by then-Gov. Sam Adams, Paul Revere, it's pretty significant,' he said. 'I'm very fond of saying ... that the history of Massachusetts is the history of America, and it's very true and this is another evidence of that.'

The excavation came just months after another time capsule was uncovered from the Old State House, which served as the state's first seat of government. That long-forgotten time capsule, dating to 1901, turned up in a lion statue atop the building and, when opened, was found to contain a potpourri of well-preserved items including newspaper clippings, a book on foreign policy and a letter from journalists of the period."
"468","The state of North Dakota has named a new publicly-owned landfill after President Barack Obama.

In an overwhelming 35-10 vote, the state Senate advanced a bill naming a 650-acre site currently under construction after the nation’s 44th president. Governor Jack Dalrymple is expected to sign the measure into law Tuesday.

When completed, the Barack Obama Memorial Landfill will be the largest waste disposal site in North Dakota, and the 17th largest in the United States. It will be especially rich in toxic waste from the local petroleum and medical industries.

“We wanted to do something to honor the president,” says Republican State Senator Doug Perlman, who was the lead sponsor of the bill. “And I think a pile of garbage is a fitting tribute to Obama’s presidency.

“We originally planned on naming it after a nearby mountain. But then someone jokingly suggested we name it after Obama. I never thought and idea like that would actually pass. But I was pleasantly surprised.”

The president is hardly popular in North Dakota. The most recent poll in December 2013 found that Obama has a 35% approval rating in the state, although that figure may have fallen further in the year since. Yet even considering the political climate, seasoned observers are surprised that two Democratic lawmakers voted for the bill’s passage.

“I supported Obama because I thought he would end the wars in the Middle East;” says Allison Mitchell, a progressive Democrat from Grand Forks. “But he decided to fight new wars abroad instead of fighting for single-payer health care and jobs here at home.

“I guess people expected me to oppose this landfill thing because I’m a Democrat. But honestly I don’t really care anymore. Maybe this small act of protest will wake him up.”

"470","Though Apple was mum about battery life for its forthcoming wrist-worn accessory when it was announced on Tuesday, the company has since said that it expects people to charge it nightly, suggesting the battery life will offer about one day of operation.

""There's a lot of new technology packed into Apple Watch and we think people will love using it throughout the day,"" Apple spokeswoman Nat Kerris said in a statement to Re/code. ""We anticipate that people will charge nightly, which is why we designed an innovative charging solution that combines our MagSafe technology and inductive charging.""

But sources who spoke with John Paczkowski went further, and indicated that the company isn't happy with the current uptime of the Apple Watch. One person said the watch's battery life is currently ""about a day,"" and that the company is working on modifications ahead of its launch to improve it.

A one-day battery life is about on par with other touchscreen smart watches currently available on the market, including devices running the competing Android Wear platform.

The uptime stands in contrast to less powerful smart watches, like the Pebble, which utilizes a monochrome black-and-white display and lacks a touchscreen. Pebble's low-power screen is always on and provides up to a week of use before the wrist-borne device needs to be recharged.

Battery life for the Apple Watch remains somewhat up in the air because the product isn't yet finalized and ready for launch. Apple revealed on Tuesday that the wearable device will launch at some time in early 2015, but declined to offer a more specific window.

The company was also vague on other aspects of the hardware, including pricing. While the Apple Watch will start at $349, a breakdown of how much various models will cost was not given.

While the Apple Watch will start at $349, it's possible that the high-end models could reach into a five-figure price point. The luxury Apple Watch Edition is made of hardened 18-karat gold, and existing 18-karat gold watches typically sell for more than $10,000."
"472","American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley.

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley's executioner.

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said.

"474","Eran Cicurel, an editor at Voice of Israel, has quoted YPG fighters familiar with the situation in Kobani, saying that Gill Rosenberg was not captured by IS. Cicurel's claims contradict IS claims, which made announcements on IS-affiliated websites Samoach al-Islam, al-Platform Media, and Twitter that Rosenberg had been captured.

Earlier in the day, IS media sources even alleged that a video was coming soon. Considering the scale of yesterday's IS advance, the story appeared plausible. Close friends, comrades, and supporters also voiced credible concern on Rosenberg's Facebook page.

The YPG fighters noted, through Cicurel, that Rosenberg was not in the city of Hoban at the time that IS claims she was abducted. They also called the story ""mere propaganda"". While not a confirmation per se, Cicurel's claims, in addition to circumstantial evidence, have made the story of Rosenberg's capture implausible.

Established Israeli sources exclusively ran the story purporting to be primary sources of reporting Rosenberg's capture. The Haaretz Israeli News, the Times of Israel, the Jerusalem Post, and Ynet News almost immediately published similar reports, while media outside Israel have either not reported on the story or quoted the Israeli media. It is illegal for an Israeli citizen to travel to an Israeli-declared hostile state, including Iraq and Syria, for any reason including business and media reporting.

Rosenberg, age 31, has become infamous in recent months for joining YPG fighters in Kobani despite the illegality of her endeavor. In the past 24 hours, an IS advance pushed the YPG back on four fronts, including the northern side that borders Turkey. However, the YPG has mitigated many IS gains, due to US airstrikes and the arrival of Turkish forces sealing the border to the north.

Despite the new information, little is still publicly known about Rosenberg's status at this time. Pro-IS sources are still claiming that she is captured, while other sources are staying quiet. A link will be added in the comments if the story is officially confirmed or denied.

"475","When you complain to your cable company, you certainly don’t expect that the cable company will then contact your employer and discuss your complaint. But that’s exactly what happened to one former Comcast customer who says he was fired after the cable company called a partner at his accounting firm.

IT BEGAN INNOCENTLY ENOUGH…

Conal began subscribing to Comcast service in early 2013 after he says he was sold a 9-month promotional pricing offer. But from the start, there were issues with his service, as he was being charged for set-top boxes that had yet to be activated. Additionally, someone at Comcast billing had misspelled Conal’s last name, meaning some of his bills were not being delivered.

He says he met with a Comcast rep in May 2013 about the billing issues and promised they would all be sorted out, but things only got worse.

A few months later, the promotional discount shrunk and Conal’s monthly bill increased by $20, in addition to still being charged for unactivated devices in his house. Comcast also twice charged him an additional $7 for a second modem he did not have.

Meanwhile, attempts to get a resolution from Comcast went unanswered.

CUTTING THE CORD

He attempted to cancel his service in Oct. 2013 but says a Comcast rep convinced him that the billing issues would be resolved and that he would get free DVR service and The Movie Channel for three months as compensation.

But things didn’t just continue as they had before; Comcast somehow managed to sink even lower than it had before, sending Conal about a dozen pieces of equipment that he didn’t order.

“There were a few DVRs, modem, standard boxes and equipment that I was unfamiliar with,” he says.

Making matters worse, Comcast billed him $1,820 for all this stuff he’d never requested and had no use for.

When Conal returned all the equipment to Comcast and, being an experienced accountant at one of the nation’s most prestigious firms, even prepared a spreadsheet detailing every charge, overcharge, payment and credit on his account for his brief time as a Comcast customer.

He says even this didn’t convince Comcast that there was a problem and that Conal had been overcharged. And even though it wasn’t yet past due, Comcast sent Conal’s account into collections in Feb. 2014.

THE CALL IN QUESTION

And so on Feb. 6, 2014, he chose to try going above Comcast’s customer service, which hadn’t been of any help in the year he’d been a subscriber, and instead contacted the office of the company’s Controller. He spoke to someone in that office who promised Conal would receive a call back to address the issues.

He describes that callback as “bizarre,” with the rep not identifying which company she was calling from, just starting out with “How can I help you?” Then she kept insisting that a technician had shown up for an appointment, but wouldn’t specify which appointment. The rep then began asking him for the color of his house.

So he tried the Controller’s office again, to let them know that the rep they’d sent his way had failed miserably at her job.

During this call, he says that he mentioned that Comcast’s billing and accounting issues should probably be investigated by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a private-sector oversight operation. This ultimately led to two service calls where no one ever showed up and no explanations were given.

But something did happen. Just not anything good.

WE KNOW WHERE YOU WORK

Remember how we briefly mentioned above that Conal worked for a large, prestigious accounting firm? Comcast certainly noticed that fact, especially since that firm is one that does business with Comcast.

At some point shortly after that call, someone from Comcast contacted a partner at the firm to discuss Conal. This led to an ethics investigation and Conal’s subsequent dismissal from his job; a job where he says he’d only received positive feedback and reviews for his work.

Comcast maintained that Conal used the name of his employer in an attempt to get leverage. Conal insists that he never mentioned his employer by name, but believes that someone in the Comcast Controller’s office looked him up online and figured out where he worked.

When he was fired, Conal’s employer explained that the reason for the dismissal was an e-mail from Comcast that summarized conversations between Conal and Comcast employees.

But Conal has never seen this e-mail in order to say whether it’s accurate and Comcast has thus far refused to release any tapes of the phone calls related to this matter.

And while his former employer did provide consulting services to Comcast, it was not the accounting firm that audited Comcast’s books. So Conal doesn’t quite see how mentioning the name of his employer would have helped gain him any leverage.

In response to a letter from Conal’s lawyer — he has not filed a lawsuit, but it’s not out of the question — Comcast’s Senior Deputy General Counsel admits that the company did contact Conal’s employer but says that Conal “is not in a position to complain that the firm came to learn” about his dispute with Comcast.

THE HEART OF THE MATTER

I think whether or not Conal mentioned his employer is beside the point. The problem should not have reached the point where he was even reaching out the Comcast Controller’s office.

Had the billing issues been fixed on the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or sixth chance that he gave Comcast to address the issue, the call in question would never have happened.

And even if Conal did identify his employer in the hope of getting his billing issue fixed, he wouldn’t have been trying to get preferential treatment; just the service he’d paid for.

I’m also curious why, even though Comcast insists that Conal attempted to leverage his place of business to get his issue resolved, it has not specifically cited language that he allegedly used in the call.

How many times a day do Comcast reps hear a customer say something like “I’m a lawyer” or “I’m a big shot at [fill in the blank]“? How many of those result in Comcast going out of its way to contact that customer’s employer?

We reached out to Comcast to ask whether it’s company policy to contact customers’ employers. No one answered that question, but a rep for Comcast did give a brief statement.

“Our customers deserve the best experience every time they interact with us,” reads the statement. Comcast says it has previously apologized to Conal, but adds “we will review his lawyer’s letter and respond as quickly as possible.”"

Bunbury local Dylan Thomas’ first trip to Bali last weekend was complete with a visit to the Bali International Medical Centre to have a tropical spider pulled out of his stomach.

21-year-old Dylan awoke after a quiet night in his four and a half star hotel room to find a bizarre red trail two inches from his naval and heading upwards.

“It was as if someone had scratched me with the tip of a knife,” he said.

Later that evening, the trail had moved two or three inches higher.

When a concerned Dylan fronted up to the doctors early on Sunday morning, they told him it was a small insect bite, and gave him some antihistamine cream to rub on the red line.

Later that morning he awoke to blisters.

“That’s when it became painful, it was a searing burn,” he said.

He finally saw a dermatologist on Monday, who told him that it was something out of the ordinary.

Doctors extracted a tropical spider that had burrowed itself into the scar from Dylan’s recent appendix removal.

“It was a bit bigger than the size of a match head,” he said.

He has now earnt himself the nickname Spider-man.

“It takes a lot to deter me, but I do feel violated. It was a very bizarre experience just to know something like that was in my body for a couple of days,” Dylan said.

The doctors put the spider in a container and took it away for testing.

Dylan will be informed next week as to what kind of spider made home in his body for three days."

"478","Apple has ""studied platinum watch casings"" according to a new report in The Wall Street Journal. However, it’s not expected to announce the new case during today’s ""Spring Forward"" event. The WSJ also corroborates rumors that Apple will be redesigning its stores to include a space where customers can try on the watch by appointment.

It’s likely that Apple will be limiting the initial buying experience to its own stores, where the company has total control over the sales experience. Reuters reports that Apple resellers, like Best Buy, may not carry the watch at launch, with Macy’s, Saks, Bloomingdale's, and Barney’s expressing the same. Apple held a private event at the luxury retailer Colette in Paris back in September, hinting at a possible store-within-a-store retail strategy for Apple Watch Edition sales. Reuters notes that Nordstrom has been in discussions with Apple.

The Apple Watch will go on sale in April with 38mm and 42mm cases made from aluminum, stainless steel, and a scratch resistant 18-karat gold. Platinum is the obvious omission, a material commonly used by luxury watch makers such as Rolex and Omega.

Apple Watch strap materials include fluoroelastomer (rubber), leather, and stainless steel. While a gold strap hasn’t been announced yet, some, including Daring Fireball’s John Gruber, have speculated that it could be announced today and push the Watch Edition price to the $20,000 mark. The Watch Sport model features hardened Ion-X glass and a composite (plastic) back, while both the stainless steel Watch and gold Watch Edition models use sapphire crystal and ceramic backs.

The video starts with a clip of President Barack Obama earlier this month making the announcement that he had authorized targeted strikes in Iraq to protect American interests in Irbil. It then cuts to a title scene that says ""Message to America"" before cutting to a desert scene, with Foley in orange clothes on his knees, and a man in all black standing next to him. 

In the video Foley delivers a statement calling on his friends and family to ""rise up against my real killers, the U.S. government.""

Then the ISIS member makes a statement. Speaking in what may possibly be a British accent, he identifies Foley and says his death is a direct result of American intervention in Iraq. 

""So any attempt by you Obama, to deny the Muslims of living in safety under Islamic caliphate will result in the bloodshed of your people.""

He then beheads Foley.

Freelance journalist Steven Joel Sotloff is then shown also in an orange jumpsuit on his knees. The man in black then says ""The life of this American citizen Obama, depends on your next decision.""

About 20 minutes after posting the video was removed from YouTube.

According to BuzzFeed, two people who know Foley confirmed that the man in the video looks and sounds like him.

In a statement, National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said that if the video is genuine they are ""appalled by the brutal murder."" 

""We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist and we express our deepest condolences to his family and friends. We will provide more information when it is available.”

Foley, 40, grew up in New Hampshire and was originally a teacher, at one point teaching prison inmates in Arizona, before attending the Medill school of journalism at Northwestern University. After graduation, his first assignment was as an embed with the U.S. Army’s 173rd Brigade and 101st Airborne Division in Afghanistan.  Foley had been covering the Syria's civil war for GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse (AFP) when he was allegedly pulled from the car he was traveling in to meet with a colleague and abducted at gunpoint.

Ferguson: An audio recording released on Tuesday morning may shed light on the death of a Missouri teenager fatally shot by a police officer August 9, which have sparked protests that resumed this week.

The tape, provided to CNN, allegedly contains audio captured during a Ferguson resident's video chat at the time of the shooting. CNN says the authenticity of the tape has yet to be verified, but what appears to be gunfire can be heard in the background of the call.

As many as 10 shot-like sounds can be heard. Several shots are fired in what appears to be fairly quick succession. There is a brief pause, then more shots are fired.

An autopsy concluded that Michael Brown, 18, was shot six times, with two fatal shots to the head. The Ferguson officer involved has been identified as Darren Wilson, 28.

Law enforcement officials and bystanders have provided differing accounts of what led to the fatal encounter. Police say Mr Wilson stopped Brown and a friend for walking in the street, asking the two to move to the sidewalk, and words were exchanged. According to Mr Wilson's account, he was attacked by Brown as he attempted to exit his cruiser and the two scuffled for the officer's gun inside the car.

Both Mr Wilson and witnesses concede Brown took off running. The witnesses say the officer fired on the unarmed teen as he had his hands up to surrender. Wilson supporters say Brown was bull-rushing Wilson, who shot Brown in self-defense.

The shooting ignited racial tensions, sparking several days and nights of protests, riots, looting and unrest, which have resumed.

More than 100 demonstrators marched in St. Louis on Tuesday demanding the arrest of a white police officer who shot dead an unarmed black teenager in Ferguson, Missouri.

The protesters, who called for Mr Wilson's arrest and the removal of Ferguson police leaders, were blocked from walking up the courthouse steps by a group of officers, most on bicycles.

Few signs were visible at what has been the centre of the protests along West Florissant in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb.

A man under a gazebo sold T-shirts that read ""Hands up, don't shoot,"" the chant favoured by demonstrators, as the temperature reached 34 Celsius at midday.

People gathered in small groups at the impromptu memorial set up where Brown died and two women handed out food from a folding table.

""This community has had a story to tell for a long time and this has just been the catalyst,"" said Chelsea Warlick, 29, a photographer from Savannah, Georgia. The majority of people in Ferguson are black, while most of its elected officials and police force are white.

Ms Warlick, who laid white roses by the memorial, said she was about to sign a six-month lease on an apartment in the complex where Brown lived to support the community.

""The verdict is everything. If he doesn't go to jail for what he did this place is going to burn,"" she said of Mr Wilson.

The Missouri National Guard, which began a gradual pullout from Ferguson on Friday, was absent from a spot on West Florissant they had occupied late on Monday.

Brown's funeral service was Monday, and the case is currently being presented to a grand jury. Attorney General Eric Holder has promised a thorough investigation.

The organisation Black Lawyers for Justice plans to file a $US200 million class action lawsuit against Ferguson authorities Tuesday, KDSK-TV reported. According to the organisation's website, the group's mission is to fight police brutality.

"484","OTTAWA - The man who is reported to have shot an assailant on Parliament Hill today is a former police officer with a background in providing security services for dignitaries, including members of the Royal Family.

Kevin Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick.

The 58-year-old was appointed director of security operations for the House of Commons in June 2005.

He had previously worked as aide-de-camp for New Brunswick's lieutenant-governor.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament buildings.

As an RCMP officer, Vickers has been responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives.

""MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,"" tweeted New Democrat Craig Scott.

"487","With Apple's media event just a week away and the company expected to offer final details there on the Apple Watch ahead of its April debut, The New York Times has a new report out sharing a few new tidbits on the device.

Among the interesting details is the existence of an unannounced ""Power Reserve"" mode for the watch that will display only the time and cut off all other functions as the battery begins to run critically low, preserving the most basic functionality of the watch. The report also notes that while the Apple Watch has been widely tested by Apple employees, the company did work to conceal many of those prototypes by disguising them to resemble Samsung smartwatches.

Sources have also provided more context to a Wall Street Journal article from last month that discussed how many of the originally planned health features for Apple Watch were dropped due to consistency issues. According to The New York Times' sources, the decision to drop many of those features came more than 18 months ago, refuting off-target reports in recent weeks claiming the cuts have come at the last minute.Nearly two years ago, the company experimented with advanced health monitoring sensors that tracked blood pressure and stress, among other variables. Many of those experiments were abandoned more than 18 months ago after the sensors proved unreliable and cumbersome, these people said.

Apple long ago decided that for the first version of the product, it would include a heart rate sensor and a sensor for tracking movement, to market the device as a fitness-tracking companion to the iPhone. Previous reports have indicated Apple is still working on those technologies, and they could appear in future versions of the Apple Watch.

Today's report reveals some additional insight into the development process, noting that the Apple Watch is coming a bit later than originally hoped due to technical challenges that were likely exacerbated by the loss of several engineers working on the project. Google's Nest Labs, headed by iPod pioneer Tony Fadell, was responsible for poaching several of the key Apple Watch employees.

Apple's media event will take place at 10:00 AM Pacific Time on Monday, March 9 at the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco. The company will offer a live video stream of the event, and MacRumors will provide full coverage of the event.

The video begins with the team searching a compound; however, when they hear gunfire they decide to investigate where it is coming from.

Tokyo: Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader who has mysteriously been missing from the public eye for almost a month, sparking rumours ranging from a stroke to a coup d'etat, is apparently just recovering from ankle surgery.

Mr Kim had fractured both of his ankles and had surgery in Pyongyang in the middle of September to treat them, the Chosun Ilbo, South Korea's largest newspaper, reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed source.

""I heard that Kim Jong-un injured his right ankle in June after pushing ahead with on-site visits and ended up fracturing both ankles because he left the injury unattended,"" the source said, adding that the leader had had the operation at the Bonghwa Clinic, an exclusive hospital for high-ranking party members.

Such is the fascination with North Korea, the world's most impenetrable country, that rumours spread like wildfire. But they are almost always impossible to verify.

Nevertheless, it is true that Mr Kim has become noticeably more rotund since he took over the leadership of North Korea from his father, Kim Jong-il, in December 2011. He was pictured limping in July during a ceremony to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the death of his grandfather, former North Korean leader Kim Il-sung, causing speculation about his health.

But the gossip mill started up again last week when Mr Kim, the third-generation leader of North Korea, missed a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly in Pyongyang. He has not been seen in public since September 3, when he attended a concert with his wife. The rumours went into overdrive when the state-run Korean Central TV said the ""Great Successor"" was in an ""indisposed condition"".

""Despite some discomfort, our Marshal continues to come out and lead the people,"" said the narrator of a documentary called Improving the Lives of the People, showing footage of Kim limping through the Taedonggang Tile Factory last month.

Outside commentators have guessed that Mr Kim has gout, which runs in the family, or has been drinking and eating too much. Diabetes and high blood pressure have also been put forward as possible causes of his absence.

Weibo, China's version of Twitter, went crazy this week with reports that Jo Myong Rok, a North Korean vice-marshal who died four years ago, had overthrown Kim in a coup and sent his lieutenants to South Korea for negotiations. Talk spread so quickly that the Global Times, one of China's official papers, ran a commentary on Monday titled: ""For those who make up rumours of coup in North Korea, is it so funny?""

According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), the militant group has Russian-made MiG 21 and 23 warplanes.

The Observatory said the militants are being trained at the al Jarrah airbase on the eastern side of Aleppo.

Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the SOHR, said officers from the Iraqi army who had defected to Islamic State (IS) had ""overseen the training of some militants in order to be able to lead these aircraft"".

He said local activist had contacted his organisation having spotted the planes flying low over the area. ""It is worth mentioning that it is not the first time that the people witness an aircraft flying at a low altitude after taking off from al Jarrah airbase,"" Rahman said, adding that the jets were purportedly stolen by militants who had occupied airports and airbases affiliated to the Syrian government.

The SOHR said it could not confirm if the Islamic State had any access to missiles.

""We're not aware of (Islamic State) conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,"" US Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder said.

""We continue to keep a close eye on (Islamic State) activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centers of gravity, wherever they may be.""

The owner of a £1.5 million Bugatti Veyron supercar could be left with a £500,000 dent in their pocket after crude vandals painted a huge penis on its bonnet.

Yobs targeted the silver-coloured car which was parked in a street in Seattle, US.

The Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Grand Sport is the world’s most expensive production car and is capable of going from 0 to 60mph in just 2.6 seconds.

But its flashy owner will be reeling, as the graffiti is set to slash a whopping half a million pounds off the racing car's retail value.

The image was posted on Reddit this week, with some users condemning the graffiti artists for vandalism and other suggesting it was the handiwork of a jilted lover.

One Twitter user even suggested it could be a sign of activism by the culprit.

"499","A newly released audio recording aired by CNN Monday purportedly captures the sound of gunfire from the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo.

The unauthenticated audio was recorded by a man who says he was taping a video chat conversation when the shooting of the unarmed black teen by a white police officer occurred around noon on Saturday, Aug. 9.

CNN said it could not independently verify the authenticity of the audio. The man's attorney, Lopa Blumenthal, said that her client discussed the tape with the FBI. The FBI has yet to comment on whether it questioned the man who made the recording.

""He heard loud noises and at the time he didn't even realize the import of what he was hearing until afterwards,"" Blumenthal told CNN's Don Lemon. ""It just happened to have captured 12 seconds of what transpired outside of his building.""

On the audio, a man can be heard video-chatting a friend while shots ring out in the background. After a pause in the gunfire, more shots can be heard.

A forensic audio expert told the network that he detected a cluster of six gunshots followed by four more after the pause on the recording. A private autopsy ordered by Brown's family found last week that the unarmed teen had been shot at least six times, including twice in the head."
"500","Iraqi Member of Parliament Ali al-Bredi has claimed that Islamic State (IS) militants are using Chlorine gas against Iraqi soldiers in Fallujah.

In a press conference on Monday, al-Bredi revealed that IS have killed 300 Iraqi soldiers with chlorine gas.

He said that the militants deployed the gas in the Siqiliya area located of northern Fallujah, a city in Anbar province, about 70 km from the capital of Iraq, Baghdad.

“Responsibility for this lies with Iraqi PM Haidar Abadi and the commander of the forces in Anbar as they failed to rescue the  soldiers,” said al-Bredi.

Expanding on the circumstances surrounding the attack, al-Bredi said, “After the insurgents surrounded the Iraqi soldiers, they used chlorine gas to suffocate them before detonating a car bomb, resulting in the death of 300 out of 400 soldiers.”

Al-Bredi also said that before the crime was committed, the soldiers asked for an urgent rescue mission, but were ignored.

Furthermore, on Sunday, US Secretary of State John Kerry also reiterated US concern over the use of chlorine gas against civilians in Syria and warned President Bashar al-Assad’s regime that it would be held to account."
"502","Just moments after he gunned down Canadian Parliament shooter Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, heroic sergeant-at-arms Kevin Vickers was seen calmly walking through the halls, gun in hand.

The 58-year-old RCMP veteran has been hailed a hero after putting a swift stop to the attacker's hail of gunfire after he shot dead a soldier and then stormed the building on Wednesday morning.

A CBC News still shows Vickers holding the gun and walking through the House of Commons' moments after taking down the assailant.

Vickers has been the House of Commons' head of security since 2005 and will now go down in history as one of its most memorable after he bravely pursued and took down Zehaf-Bibeau.

Job done: Kevin Vickers, Canada's House of Commons' sergeant-at-arms, looks around the hallways with a gun in his hand after shooting dead an attacker, Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, on Wednesday morning

In control: Vickers, who worked for the RCMP for 29 years before taking on the role, is being hailed a hero

Despite working for the RCMP for three decades, relatives said the incident was the first time in his career that Vickers had ever shot anyone.

Riveting video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons on Wednesday makes startlingly real just how heart-thumpingly dangerous the situation was that Vickers heroically diffused.

A rush of armed police can be seen running toward an unseen suspect as the video from Globe and Mail opens.

At the head of the pack is a man moving swiftly with his gun in hand toward Zehaf-Bibeau, who had moments before murdered a reservist who stood guard at Canada's Tomb of the Unknown soldier.

The death of that man, a 24-year-old father of a young son, Nathan Cirillo, would soon be avenged as Vickers takes aim inside the cavernous parliamentary building and fires off multiple shots.

As those shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

Inches from disaster: The terrifying morning attack happened just outside the MPs' caucus rooms

And like that, it was over. Vickers had brought to a close the terrifying scene of senseless violence in mere moments of professional poise.

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers has honed his peacekeeping skills over a prestigious 28-year career as a member Royal Canadian Mounted Police.

And peacekeeping is the word. According to his brother, Wednesday's showdown was Vickers' first exchange of gunfire with a suspect in his nearly three-decade long career.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Vickers - already back in work - was greeted by a standing ovation from parliament. Humbly nodding his head, the police veteran received handshakes from leading politicians.

Vickers remained mostly expressionless during the ovation before briefly appearing close to tears, and eventually acknowledging the applause with several nods of thanks

He released a statement paying tribute to Nathan Cirillo and revealed another police officer was shot in the leg.

'I am very touched by the attention directed at me following yesterday’s events. However, I have the support of a remarkable security team that is committed to ensuring the safety of Members, employees and visitors to the Hill,' he said.

'On behalf of all members of the House of Commons Security Services team, I would like to extend our deepest condolences to the family of Cpl. Nathan Cirillo. Our prayers are with you. Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Earlier in the morning, a man was arrested for getting too close to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his wife Laureen as they placed flowers at the scene of the shooting.

Armed officers ordered the unidentified man to the ground for 'disturbing the crime scene' after he was warned not to cross the crime tape but did.

On Wednesday evening Harper addressed his nation from an undisclosed location and condemned the horrific actions but vowed his country's foreign policy would not be thrown off course.

'Canada will never be intimidated,' he said.

Queen Elizabeth released a statement to the country saying she was saddened by the events.

'Prince Philip and I were shocked and saddened by the events in Ottawa. Our thoughts and prayers are with all those affected' she said.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don’t understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don’t know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.

Arrest: An unidentified man was arrested for disturbing the crime scene as security concerns are still high across Ottawa

Chilling footage appears to have caught the moment that gunman Michael Zehaf-Bibeau got into a hijacked car moments after shooting a soldier dead at Ottawa's War Memorial.

Footage from a dashcam appears to show the Muslim convert climb into the driver's side of a Toyota Corolla that - according to witnesses - he had stolen earlier.

Zehaf-Bibeau stormed the Parliament minutes later having abandoned the car in the street with the engine running after he had driven a short distance from the cenotaph.

A shoot-out with armed officials ensued, with Zehaf-Bibeau eventually shot dead by Vickers as shocked politicians and journalists barricaded themselves in rooms and cowered in corridors.

One eye witness said that as many as 30 shots were fired in the exchange, which took place just yards away from where Prime Minister Stephen Harper was speaking.

The 32-year-old had callously shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a 24-year-old father, in the stomach at point-blank range while he was on ceremonial duty.

Despite the desperate efforts of medics, Mr Cirillo succumbed to his injuries in hospital.

A witness told The Ottawa Citizen that he'd seen a man armed with a double-barrelled shotgun wearing a scarf 'hijack a car'.

He added: 'It was pretty intense.'"

The man told medics he felt his small penis was to blame for the fact he had been dumped by his girlfriend, and as it was useless, decided to cut it off.

Oliver Ilic, 22, had called medics after he couldn’t stop the bleeding and was taken on a stretcher in bloodstained jeans to hospital in the eastern Macedonian town of Kocani.

Police searched his house and discovered the severed organ in a bin after it had been cut off with a single swipe from a razor blade which was also in the bin.

Although it was delivered to the local hospital, doctors realised they didn’t have the competence to reattach the member. Instead Ilic was transferred to the hospital in the capital Skopje where surgeons managed to reattach it in a complicated five-hour operation.

It’s still too early to know if the operation would be a success and if it worked, whether the man’s organ would ever function properly again.

He then ran into the 80-foot-long East Room, an ornate space often used for receptions or presidential addresses.

Gonzalez was tackled by a counter-assault agent at the far southern end of the East Room. The intruder reached the doorway to the Green Room, a parlor overlooking the South Lawn with artwork and antique furniture, according to three people familiar with the incident.

Secret Service officials had earlier said he was quickly detained at the main entry. Agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said the office is not commenting due to an ongoing investigation of the incident.

News of the stolen planes have now created concerns for officials, who fear the militants may use them to carry out acts of terrorism against America.
“Libya is now a source of danger not only for neighbouring Maghreb countries, but for all countries of the world,” said a Moroccan reporter shortly after news broke of the stolen jetliners.
According to veteran reporter Bill Gertz, U.S. officials said that they received intelligence indicating eleven commercial aircraft could be used to attack New York City or Washington, D.C. on the anniversary of the September, 11, 2001 jihadi attacks on America.
“There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes,” said one unidentified government official.
Tripoli Airport is currently occupied by two rival groups deemed “terrorists” by the Libyan parliament: Misrata and Zintan, who had previously worked together to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi.

"509","BEIRUT (AP) — Lebanese authorities detained a woman and young boy believed to be the wife and son of the reclusive Islamic State group leader, and were questioning the woman and conducting DNA tests on the child, senior Lebanese officials said Tuesday.

If their identities are confirmed, Lebanon may use the pair as bargaining chips to win the release of soldiers and police taken hostage by the extremists in cross-border attacks earlier this year.

The woman, who was identified as an Iraqi, and the child were taken into custody about 10 days ago while carrying fake ID cards, the officials said.

Very little is known about Islamic State group leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi's personal life, including how many wives and children he has. Conservative interpretations of Islam allow men to marry up to four wives. The Islamic State group did not immediately comment on the detentions, but the faction's supporters on Twitter and militant websites cast doubt on the reports.

Adding to the confusion, the Lebanese army did not release an official statement regarding the pair.

A Lebanese military official identified the woman as Saja al-Dulaimi who was held by Syrian authorities and freed in a prisoner exchange with the Nusra Front, Syria's al-Qaida-linked branch, earlier this year. The official said the woman ""confessed during interrogation"" that she was al-Baghdadi's wife.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity in line with regulations.

In March, the Nusra Front freed more than a dozen Greek Orthodox nuns in exchange for the release of dozens of female prisoners by the Syrian government. A woman named Saja al-Dulaimi was reportedly on the list of prisoners freed by Damascus.

A judicial official said the interrogation of the woman was being supervised by Lebanon's military prosecutor, Saqr Saqr, and that a DNA test was underway to confirm that the child is her son. Experts said it would be difficult to confirm whether the woman is indeed al-Baghdadi's wife.

It was unclear what would have brought the woman and child to Lebanon, where IS controls no territory and enjoys only small — although growing — support in some predominantly Sunni Muslim areas.

The detentions added to the mystery that continues to surround al-Baghdadi, who has a $10 million U.S. bounty on his head. He has only made one known public appearance — a sermon he delivered in July at a mosque in Mosul just days after IS declared him the head of an Islamic state, or caliphate, in the territory the group controls in Syria and Iraq.

Last month, Iraqi officials claimed he was wounded in an airstrike. The U.S. has not confirmed those reports, and al-Baghdadi released a new audiotape days after he was purportedly hit.

The Lebanese daily As-Safir first reported the detention of the Islamic State leader's alleged relatives, saying the woman and boy were taken into custody near a border crossing point with Syria. It said the arrest came in ""coordination with foreign intelligence agencies.""

If the pair's identities are confirmed, the detentions could give Lebanese authorities leverage in their attempts to reach a prisoner-exchange deal with militants from the Islamic State group and the Nusra Front. The extremists have been holding more than 20 Lebanese soldiers and policemen hostage since August, and have demanded the release of Islamist prisoners held by Lebanon. On Monday night, the Nusra Front threatened to kill one of the soldiers it holds captive.

Lebanese troops have clashed repeatedly with militants along the border with Syria since August.

On Tuesday, militants ambushed a Lebanese army patrol near the frontier, killing six soldiers and wounding one, Lebanon's military said. The attack occurred in a remote region of Ras Baalbek in eastern Lebanon and was followed by clashes, the army said in a statement.

It was not immediately clear who was behind the attack, but there was no immediate indication that it was connected to the detention of al-Baghdadi's alleged family members.

Meanwhile, supporters of the Islamic State group released a video claiming responsibility for a shooting that wounded a Danish citizen in the Saudi capital of Riyadh last month.

The video, posted online Monday by the Al-Battar Media Foundation, shows a gunman pulling up beside a vehicle and firing five times at the man inside, identified as Thomas Hoepner. The video's authenticity could not be confirmed but it was posted on a website commonly used by militants.

Saudi security officials say a Danish man was shot while driving Nov. 22, and that he was treated for shoulder wounds. They did not release his name.

If confirmed, the shooting would be the first attack on foreigners in the kingdom carried out by Islamic State supporters. About a decade ago, al-Qaida militants seeking to topple the Western-allied monarchy launched a wave of attacks that killed scores of security forces and Westerners in Saudi Arabia.

The video also includes audio clips of Islamic State group leaders calling on supporters to launch attacks inside the kingdom.

In Brussels, Danish Foreign Minister Martin Lidegaard told reporters Tuesday that ""the Dane is doing better.""

Denmark and Saudi Arabia are part of the U.S.-led coalition conducting airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Iraq and Syria.

The shop will likely be located near the entrance of the iconic Wonder Room, a 19,000-square-foot shopping hall that houses a wide selection of luxury jewelry and watch brands alongside a concept store and mezzanine wine bar.

Wonder Room at Selfridges in London houses fine jewelry and watches
A section of Selfridges located near the Wonder Room was boarded up earlier this month to allow for construction of the expected Apple Watch pop-up shop, sources say. The store-within-a-store concept will display various Apple Watch models and provide customers with a personalized shopping experience, potentially including One to One service for those interested in learning more about the wrist-worn device.

Apple is recruiting retail employees from nearby Apple Stores in London to fill Specialist vacancies at an upcoming Central London location, which is likely to be this Selfridges boutique. The pop-up shop is expected to be readied in time for the Apple Watch launch in April and will likely join Galeries Lafayette as one of multiple standalone Apple Watch stores that Apple plans to open throughout Europe.

Selfridges has the second-largest retail space in the United Kingdom behind competing high-end department store Harrods. The store offers a myriad of designer jewelry and accessories, such as watches, bracelets, earrings, necklaces, pendants and rings. With the Apple Watch positioned at least partially as a fashion item, the department store offers an ideal setting for the wrist-worn device to be displayed.

"511","The leaked video of Georgy Myakinkin's protest against heavy-handed security guards at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia, has gone viral

This is the moment an airport worker protested against 'rough' security guards - by stripping NAKED and walking through the scanner in just his socks.

Georgy Myakinkin, 31, left his keys at work following his shift at Pulkovo Airport in St Petersburg, Russia.

When he returned to collect them, he says ""heavy-handed"" security guards stopped him 'unnecessarily' and told him he had to remove his belt.

Staging an impromptu protest, he then stripped naked - apart from his socks - before sauntering through the scanner, leaving the guards gobsmacked.

CEN   Bare cheek: Down come the trousers

He said: ""I returned to the airport and was just in the section where trains arrive with passengers when I was stopped and asked to remove my belt before going through a scanner.

""I know the rules and I know that it isn't necessary here in the pre-flight area to be so strict - security guards were just being heavy-handed.

""When I refused and told them I wanted to just get my keys, they called police.""

CEN   Strip-gate: But he left socks on before passing through

Georgy whipped off his clothes and walked through the scanner. The speechless officers then allowed him to dress and leave.

But when he turned up for work the next day, he discovered that the CCTV security camera video had been leaked and gone viral.

The Russian Interior Ministry's transport department in the Northwestern Federal District said it is currently investigating the alleged breach of security.

CEN   Viral: He retrieves watch in video which was leaked

A spokesman said: ""We are looking into the matter and have nothing more to say at this moment.""

Georgy has filed a complaint against police over the leaked video.

He said: ""I know that they just leaked it in order to embarrass me, but I will have the last laugh.""

An article appeared on ikwiz claims that the film-maker has approached Disney for an early release of the movie, which is currently scheduled to hit the theatres on 18 December.

Kanye West banned from attending future grammy awards. Is this real?

Origins: On 9 February 2015, the entertainment website Adobo Chronicles published an article claiming that rapper Kanye West had been barred from all future award shows:

He did it again. Rapper Kanye West reprised his most infamous stunt at Sunday night's Grammy awards, taking the stage as Beck was accepting the album of the year award.

After this latest incident, organizers of the major awards shows like the Grammys, MTV Video Music Awards, People's Choice Awards and the Oscars have unanimously agreed to disinvite and bar West from their respective ceremonies. The television networks that air these awards programs also joined in the 'West boycott.'

While it is true that West created a stir at the 2015 Grammy Awards when he briefly interrupted Beck during the musician's acceptance speech (just as he had done to Taylor Swift in 2009), Kanye has not been banned from all future award shows.

The App Store's 'Top Apps' lists are well known to the smartphone-savvy public, but how apps make it into those lists is perhaps less understood. Today, one micro-blog shared photos under the heading ""It's Hard Being a Top App Worker,"" publicly exposing the operations behind App Store rank-boosting (Ed: which I henceforth dub 'crank-boosting') labour. 

The exposé, shown in the picture, displays a 'Top App list worker' in their work place, which features a simple shelf containing hundreds of iPhone 5Cs. In a room filled with such workstations from one side to the other, mobile phone labour takes place at an industrial level. Simply put, a worker downloads (and deletes and downloads, etc.) an app to boost its rank on the App Store, calculated by how many times the app has been downloaded. One worker can operate as up to 100 unique users. 

Apple has previously adopted measures to deter crank-boosting in order to ensure fair rankings for developers and users. In 2014 November, Apple introduced a 1 yuan strategy to drop the threshold for users to download apps, also intended to negatively impact the crank-boosting industry. 

But as crank-boosting simulates genuine user activity, it is nearly impossible to detect or safeguard against. 

Users accustomed to comparing and contrasting apps before download may be unknowingly swayed by crank-boosted apps that have purchased their celebrity. Such sneaky, industrious operations are tricky to break."

CBI files case against Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh over forced castration IANS
The agency filed case against the Dera Sacha Sauda chief on Wednesday on charges of criminal conspiracy, cheating, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons and criminal intimidation under the Indian Penal Code, following an order by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.
Hansraj Chauhan, a former Dera follower, had filed a petition in the high court in 2012 alleging that he along with around 400 male devotees of the Dera were castrated inside the ashram on the orders of Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh.
Disposing off the petition, the high court had ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation into the case in December 2014. The court asked the CBI to file the first status report by 2 March.
Chauhan had demanded a CBI inquiry and compensation for the castration inside the ashram in 2000. Chauhan claimed that the castration of Dera followers was done by the chief through doctors employed in his hospital.
Chauhan said in his petition that he along with other devotees was castrated under false claims that they would be able to realise god through the Dera chief after their castration.
Haryana Police handed over the documents related to the incident to the CBI on 2 January. Haryana Police also provided documents related to seven other devotees of the Dera chief who also claimed to be castrated.
 

The Dera has dismissed the castration allegation. Gurmeet Ram Rahim, who is making his film debut with ""MSG: The Messenger of God"", is also facing trial in connection with cases of murder of a journalist and sexual exploitation of his women disciples."
"520","The Islamist militant group Boko Haram has agreed to a ceasefire and the release of more than 200 kidnapped school girls, according to Nigerian officials. The girls were abducted six months ago from a school in Chibok.

Nigerian government officials claimed on Friday to have struck a two-part deal with Boko Haram, including a ceasefire and the release of 219 school girls, whose abduction last April sparked international outrage.
""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Hassan Tukur, who represented the Nigerian government at talks with the militant organization in neighboring Chad. ""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued
The girls have been missing for the past six months, despite international efforts mobilized by the Twitter hashtag campaign #BringBackOurGirls to rescue them from captivity. France, Great Britain and the United States have helped with the search for the girls, while China, Israel and other nations have also provided various forms of assistance.
Nearly 300 girls were kidnapped from a boarding school in the northeastern town of Chibok on April 14, but dozens managed to subsequently escape. Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan has been criticized by the girls' families for responding slowly to their abduction.

Boko Haram, whose name roughly translates to ""Western education is sacrilege,"" seeks to impose a strict interpretation of Shariah law in northern Nigeria. During its early years, the Sunni militant group engaged in isolated skirmishes with Nigerian security forces. But after a bloody government crackdown in 2009, Boko Haram launched a broad insurgency. Last summer, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau declared a calipate in the areas under his forces control.
Boko Haram's insurgency has been characterized by a brutal campaign of bombings and shootings targeting Christian churches, Muslim mosques, schools, markets, bars, villages, police stations and even a UN building. An estimated 5,000 Nigerians have been killed and a further 300,000 displaced by the violence.
In 2013, the Nigerian government declared a state of emergency in the northeastern states of Borno, Yobe, and Adamawa. Amnesty International has accused the Nigerian military of war crimes, including extrajudicial killings, in its fight against Boko Haram. The United Nations and Human Rights Watch have also alleged that Nigeria's security forces have committed human rights abuses.
Nigeria's population of 177 million people is 50 percent Muslim and 40 percent Christian. Muslims are concentrated in the north and Christians in the south. The remaining 10 percent of the population practices indigenous beliefs.

"521","Apple apparently wanted its smartwatches to focus heavily on health-related features, but the company was forced to changed direction mid-development. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company originally envisioned a device that can monitor heart rate, blood pressure and stress levels (based on the conductivity of the skin). Unfortunately, the sensors they tested just didn't pass muster, which isn't entirely surprising, since we've reviewed plenty of wearables with patchy heart rate monitors in the past. The company's engineers found that hairy arms, dry skin and even how tightly the watch is worn can affect the results, and they didn't find a solution in time.

Apple Watch became known as a black hole within the company, the WSJ's sources said, as it continued sucking in resources for four years despite all the failures during testing. Its development slowed down once the company realized that a health-focused watch that meets its standards will be very hard to build at this time. The lineup of watches due out in April are a lot different from the original one Apple envisioned and are more of an iPhone companion with a much simpler pulse monitor and pedometer.

Still, the company's expecting to sell a ton, reportedly ordering around 6 million units from its Asian suppliers just for the first quarter. Half of those are the entry-level Apple Watch Sports, while the mid-tier stainless steel model makes up a third of that number. As for Cupertino's original vision, well, there's always a chance that we'll see it come to life in the coming years. The company has a good track record of substantially improving its devices after a debut model appears -- the first iPhone didn't have 3G.

"524","Apple would never lower itself to rubbing elbows with the unwashed masses at CES, but it does like to throw out a few announcements during the show to get under everyone’s skin. Cupertino has been quiet thus far, but rumors are swirling about a 12-inch MacBook Air refresh, and this isn’t just a spec bump. Apple is reportedly redesigning the iconic laptop to be even thinner with a higher resolution screen.
Sources inside the company who have used the prototype notebook (code named MacBook Stealth) say it will eschew many of the conventional laptop features in the name of advancing design. The current MacBook Air’s taper toward the front edge, which gives them a very slim profile, but there’s still space near the back for the power connector and full-sized USBs. The new Air, however, won’t be thick enough for a USB port. Instead, Apple will start using the new type-c reversible connectors. There also won’t be an SD card slot or a MagSafe power connector–even Apple’s beloved Thunderbolt is taking a hike. USB will do it all.
MBA
The 12-inch laptop would be substantially smaller and lighter than the 13-inch model, and even slightly smaller than the 11-inch version. This is thanks to slimmer bezels and a slightly more compact keyboard with less separate between keys. 9to5Mac doesn’t have details on exactly how high the resolution will be, but the current Airs are sitting at 1366 x 768 (11-inch) and 1440 x 900 (13-inch). Stepping it up to a Retina Display resolution of 2560 x 1600 (like the 13-inch Pro) would be amazing in the Air’s form factor.

To be clear, all the images of this supposed notebook are renders created by 9to5Mac. This is still thoroughly in the rumor category, but it’s a redesign we’ve been expecting for a long time. The updated MacBook Air could be announced in mid-2015.

"526","Boston| 
A Catholic priest from Massachussetts was officially dead for more than 48 minutes before medics were able to miraculously re-start his heart. During that time, Father John Micheal O’neal claims he went to heaven and met God, which he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

The 71-year old cleric was rushed to the hospital on January 29 after a major heart attack, but was declared clinically dead soon after his arrival. With the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, that kept the blood flowing to his brain, doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm.

The doctors were afraid he would have suffered some brain damage from the incident, but he woke up less than 48 hours later and seems to have perfectly recovered.

The elderly man claims that he has clear and vivid memories of what happened to him while he was dead. He describes a strange out-of-body experience, experiencing an intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance, as well as being surrounded by an overwhelming light.

He claims that at that point in his experience, he went to heaven and encountered God, which he describes as a feminine, mother-like “Being of Light”.

“Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting” states the Catholic priest. “She had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace. The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!”

The declarations of the cleric caused quite a stir in the catholic clergy of the archdiocese over the last few days, causing the Archbishop to summon a press conference to try and calm the rumors.
Despite the disapproval of his superiors, Father O’neal says that he will continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the “Holy Mother”.

“I wish to continue preaching” says the elderly cleric. “I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman…”

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston has not confirmed however, if they will allow Father O’neal to resume his preaching in his former parish in South Boston.

The Archbishop of Boston, Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, made a public statement this morning stating that Father O’neal suffered hallucinations linked to a near-death experience and that God clearly isn’t a female.

"527","A hallucinogenic fungi has been found growing in the Queen’s garden at Buckingham Palace after being discovered by gardening expert Alan Titchmarsh.

The television presenter unearthed the fungi at Buckingham Palace for an ITV gardening show called The Queen’s Garden, and said: “I won’t be eating any of that.”

Titchmarsh came across the red and white spotted toadstool — called Amanita muscaria, or fly agaric — on a tour of the private 40-acre plot with ecology expert Professor Mick Crawley.

Titchmarsh, 65, asks in an ITV show to be screened on Christmas Day: “Is it edible?”

Professor Crawley replies: “That depends what you mean. It’s eaten in some cultures for its hallucinogenic affects. But it also makes people who eat it very sick.

“The old-fashioned thing to do was to feed it to the village idiot, then drink his urine because you get all of the high without any of the sickness.”

Titchmarsh jokingly replies: “I think I’ll forgo that and stick to normal mushrooms.”

Then he adds: “Not something to try at home.”

Later he told The Sun newspaper: “That was a surprise but it shows just how varied the species are. I won’t be eating any of that, though, no. My idea of hard drugs is Nurofen.”

On the new TV show, Titchmarsh explains that gardeners actively encourage mushrooms and toadstools.

He says: “Every time they chop something down, they leave out the wood to rot.”

Magic mushroom is a slang term for any hallucinogenic fungus.

The most common, illegal form contains drug psilocybin, but there is no suggestion this grows in the Palace garden.

Last night a Palace spokesman told the Sun: “For the avoidance of doubt, fungi from the garden are not used in the Palace kitchens.”

The new programme will show viewers an entire year in the life of the Buckingham Palace garden, from the summer garden parties to the nocturnal wanderings of wildlife in the heart of London.

It will demonstrate how gardeners work tirelessly to maintain the Queen’s flowers, while bearing in mind her wish to see animals and insects made welcome in the gardens, swapping pesticides for homemade garlic treatments.

Titchmarsh will explore how bee hives, homes for insects and deposits from the Royal mews each help cultivate the gardens of Buckingham Palace, with top tips from gardeners giving insight into the Queen’s own tastes.

The programme, to be broadcast by ITV on Christmas Day, will also show how the garden has been used by the royal family for generations, from the king who planted mulberry trees to rival the French to the young Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret climbing to peer over the high garden walls.

A sandpit used by the royal children will be filmed, along with oak trees planted decades ago by the young Prince of Wales and Princess Royal, grown from acorns sown on the event of their birth.

Titchmarsh, who spent 12 months exploring how the Palace garden changed with the seasons, will be seen finishing the calendar year with a Christmas tree mounted in the Marble Hall, decorated with holly and mistletoe from the royal garden and festooned with festive golden crowns."

"530","A homeless man was given a hundred dollars, and what he did will make you cry. YouTube channel owner Josh Paler Lin decided to see it for himself and capture it all on camera.

Normally when you think of the homeless, you probably picture some drug or alcohol addict who is only taking money from passerby to support their next fix. Some of them even make more money than the average full-time employee working legally just because they’re good actors with bad clothes and not homeless at all.

Instead of assuming the worst, Josh put his money into finding the truth. He started the video asking the audience a question and explaining his idea.

“When you give homeless people money, do you ever wonder how they spent it? Today I’m going to give a homeless guy a hundred dollars, and I’m going to follow him and see how he spent it.”

Josh approached a homeless man at an intersection holding up one of the usual cardboard signs asking for help, and begins a conversation with the man. As Josh hands the man the hundred dollars, he tears up at the generosity, telling him plainly that nobody’s ever given him that much.

Josh then left the intersection as the camera remained trained on the man. As expected, the first place he went was a liquor store, but if you watch what happens, it’s not what you’re probably thinking. Coming out with a few things in bags, he made his way to the park and started handing food and other items to the homeless people there.

After witnessing this twice, Josh approached the homeless man and told him that what he saw really touched him. He confessed that he had the man followed to see what he would do, and had his doubts initially. The man told Josh that some of the homeless are just people who fell on hard luck, and he told him his story.

To reward the man for his generosity paid forward, Josh gave him another hundred dollars.

It quoted the chief of defence staff, Air Marshal Alex Badeh, as ordering his troops to immediately comply with the agreement on Friday.

The news came as another official confirmed there had been direct negotiations this week in neighbouring Chad about the release of more than 200 schoolgirls abducted six months ago. 

Al Jazeera's Haru Mutasa, reporting from Lagos, said details of the deal have yet to emerge.

""Both sides have agreed there will be no more attacks, no more bombs and no more attacks on Boko Haram.The government will not attack any Boko Haram strongholds for the moment."" Mutasa said.

""We do know Boko Haram wanted certain conditions met, for example they wanted their senior commanders released from government captivity."" Mutasa added.

Abducted schoolgirls

Sources told Al Jazeera that substantial progress had been reached in negotiations about the abducted girls but that no definite deal had been agreed.


Inside Story - Who are Nigeria's Boko Haram?
A senior adviser to Nigeria's President Goodluck Jonathan told Al Jazeera that the deal reached on Friday included the release of the girls, but that no date had been set and that the release was part of an ""ongoing process"".

Doyin Okupe said the government had agreed to ""some concessions"" but did not give any details.

Boko Haram has been demanding the release of detained fighters in exchange for the girls.

The group attracted international condemnation with the April abduction of nearly 300 girls from a boarding school in northeast Chibok town. Dozens escaped but 219 remain missing.

Nigeria's president has been criticised at home and abroad for his slow response to the abducted and for his inability to quell the violence by the group, seen as the biggest security threat to Africa's biggest economy.

Jonathan is expected to announce he will run for a second term in office on Saturday.

'Our thoughts are also with Constable Samearn Son, who has been with the House of Commons Security Services for 10 years. Constable Son suffered a gun shot wound to the leg. He is in stable condition and expected to make a full recovery.'

Vickers served with the RCMP for 29 years before assuming the role at Parliament eight years ago. The sergeant-at-arms is in charge of security at the House of Commons.

Despite his lengthy service, family members have revealed that Wednesday's attack was the first time Vickers had ever shot anyone.

'For it now to happen at Parliament ... is unbelievable,' his brother John Vickers told CNN. 'We're just relieved he's OK.'

His sister, Mary, added to the Sun News: 'We're always very proud of Kevin, but at this moment we are concerned about him - he had to make a very serious decision today.'

'He's always a natural leader. He would not have taken this decision lightly, and I can't stress that enough - but he would always expect of himself to do what he would expect of the men and women under him.'

Vickers' family gathered at homes in their hometown of Miramichi, New Brunswick to talk about previous shows of leadership.

The National Post explained how Vickers had been dispatched to the Burnt Church wharf 14 years ago when native and non-native fisherman were scrapping. He often visited when he was off-duty ready to listen to the fishermen and helping to resolve their arguments.

'The inspector was a real community man,' Bobby Sylliboy, a longtime band constable with the Burnt Church First Nation, said. 'He was a professional. And for him to use force, it would have had to have been life or death.'

Relatives added that Vickers' constable son, Andrew, is also a selfless leader after he saved a drowning woman three years ago.

After Wednesday's fraught events, MPs hailed Kevin Vickers a hero.

'I am writing this note on behalf of my husband and myself. No words can express the sadness we are feeling at this time.

'We are so sad that a man lost his life. He has lost everything and he leaves behind a family that must feel nothing but pain and sorrow. We send our deepest condolences to them although words seem pretty useless. We are both crying for them. We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, we (he) was lost and did not fit in.

I his mother spoke with him last week over lunch, I had not seen him for over five years before that. So I have very little insight to offer.

We don't wish to be part of any media circus, we don't think it will add anything to the conversation. Please respect our privacy although many may not feel we deserve any ... Once again we are so sorry.'

'MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs' caucus rooms,' tweeted New Democrat MP Craig Scott on Wednesday.

Matt Miller, the Vancouver Observer's parliamentary bureau chief, concurred.

'Kevin is definitely a hero,' Miller told CNN.

Vickers serves a largely ceremonial role at the House of Commons, carrying a scepter and wearing rich green robes, white gloves and a tall imperial tricorne hat.

A fit, tall 6-foot-4, Vickers spends many of his lunch breaks running in order to stay fit. He also carries a 9mm pistol while at work.

Both things appeared to come in extremely handy while Vickers took down the parliament terrorist Wednesday.

'It's Kevin being Kevin,' his cousin Keith told CBC. 'He's a very intelligent and responsible person. He's a people person-type fellow, too, but you don't want to mess with him.'

He was called into action after Michael Zehaf-Bibeau ran towards the National War Memorial just before 10am on Wednesday and shot Corporal Nathan Cirillo, a single dad, in the abdomen.

He then ran towards the Parliament and opened fire, shooting dozens of shots as politicians and journalists barricaded doors inside.

Video taken inside Ottawa's House of Commons shows a rush of armed police running toward an unseen suspect.

At the head of the pack is a man - Vickers - moving swiftly with his gun toward Zehaf-Bibeau. Vickers takes aim and fires off multiple shots, killing the gunman.

As shots echo throughout the hall, the video goes wobbly as the men behind their leader Vickers move for cover.

It has since emerged that the gunman - whose full name was Michael, Joseph, Paul, Abdallah Bulgasem Zehaf Bibeau - had recently converted to Islam and had a length history of petty crime.

He had also recently been designated a 'high-risk traveler' by the Canadian government and had his passport seized, according to reports.

On Thursday, his mother Susan Bibeau, who sits on the country's Immigration board, released a statement saying she had been shocked by the shooting spree and, because she had long been estranged from her son, she was unable to shed much light on why he carried out the crime.

She said she felt pain for the victims - not for the loss of her son.

'We are both crying for them,' she told the Associated Press. 'We also wish to apologize for all the pain, fright and chaos he created.

'We have no explanation to offer. I am mad at our son, I don't understand and part of me wants to hate him at this time. You write that our son was vulnerable, we don't know, he was lost.'

On Thursday, flags were flown at half-mast across Canada as a shocked and still fearful Ottawa awoke.

Harper and other MPs stopped to lay a wreath at the war memorial - but as the prime minister arrived, police wrestled a man to the ground for getting too close to the leader, CTV reported.

Security remains tight around the Parliament, as politicians and their staff returned to work on Thursday. The grounds, nearby streets and war memorial are still closed to visitors.

"534","(ANSA) - Ancona, January 23 - A Bolivian nun gave birth in San Severino Marche after being taken to hospital where she complained of a bad stomach ache, Italian newspaper Corriere Adriatico said on Friday.
    The newspaper said the nun, whose age wasn't given, gave birth last Sunday and intends to keep the baby, whose sex wasn't given.
    The nun had been staying at a cloistered convent in the province of Macerata since June.
    The hospital hasn't confirmed the birth and the bishop of nearby town Camerino, Francesco Brugnaro, hasn't made any comment on the case. Another case of a nun giving birth took place in 2011 in Marche, when a 41-year-old Congolese nun gave birth to a baby girl in Pesaro.
    In that case, the nun had been raped abroad by a foreign priest and initially gave her daughter up for adoption.
    The case engendered strong protests from the adoptive family after it reached Italy's highest court of appeals in February 2014 after the nun changed her mind and was granted custody, reversing a lower court decision."

"537","Iguala de la Independencia (Mexico) (AFP) - More bodies were being pulled out of a mass grave in southern Mexico Sunday as authorities worked to determine if 43 students who vanished after a police shooting were among the dead.

At least 15 bodies have so far been dug out of pits discovered Saturday on a hill outside the town of Iguala, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of Mexico City, two police officers at the scene told AFP.

The grim find came a week after the students disappeared when a protest turned deadly. Witnesses in Iguala say municipal police officers whisked several of the students away.

Inaky Blanco, chief prosecutor for the violence-plagued state of Guerrero, declined to say how many bodies were buried in the pits.

""We still can't talk about an exact number of bodies. We are still working at the site,"" Blanco told a news conference late Saturday in the state capital, Chilpancingo.

The site was was cordoned off and guarded by scores of troops and police.

More bodies were being recovered on Sunday, another officer said.

Juan Lopez Villanueva, an official from the National Human Rights Commission, said that six pits were found up a steep hill probably inaccessible by car.

Four forensic services vans left for the morgue late Saturday carrying nine bodies in silver bags. Authorities are conducting DNA analysis to identify the victims.

The graves were found after some of the 30 suspects detained in the case told authorities about their location, Blanco said. The detainees include 22 police officers and gang members.

If the bodies are confirmed to be those of the students, it would be one of the worst slaughters that Mexico has witnessed since the drug war intensified in 2006, leaving 80,000 people dead to date.

- Police linked to gang -

The students from a teacher training college disappeared last weekend after Iguala police officers shot at buses that the group had seized to return home after holding fundraising activities on September 26. Three students were killed.

Another three people died when police and suspected gang members shot at another bus carrying football players on the outskirts of town.

A survivor said in an interview that the officers took away 30 to 40 students in patrol cars.

Blanco said investigators had confirmed suspicions that a criminal organization, the Guerreros Unidos, was involved in last week's crimes and that local police officers belong to the gang.

Authorities have issue an arrest warrant for Iguala's mayor, who has fled.

In Pueblo Viejo, a hamlet surrounded by forests and mountains, a resident said the region is dominated by a drug gang and that he had seen municipal police officers going up the hill in recent days.

""They were going up there back and forth,"" said the resident, Jose Garcia, pointing to a location between two mountains where the graves were found.

- 'Savagely massacred' -

Governor Angel Aguirre appealed for calm in his state, which is mired in poverty, gang violence and social unrest.

""I call on all (Guerrero state residents) to maintain harmony, non-confrontation, and avoid violence,"" he said, offering his support to the families of those who were ""savagely massacred.""

The missing students are from a teacher training college near Chilpancingo known as a hotbed of protests.

Thousands of students and teachers blocked the highway between Chilpancingo and Acapulco for hours on Thursday, demanding help from federal authorities to find the missing.

The police's links to organized crime has raised fears about the fate of the students in a country where drug cartels regularly hide bodies in mass graves.

Around 30 bodies were found in mass graves in Iguala alone this year.

""We are very worried. The families are very anxious,"" said Vidulfo Rosales, a human rights lawyer representing relatives of the missing.

The United Nations has called the case ""one of the most terrible events of recent times."""
"538","On Tuesday, news spread about the reported arrest and interrogation of the wife and son of Islamic State chief Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in Lebanon.

Details about the development are still coming into focus. The AP and others reported that the two of them ""were carrying fake identification cards"" when they were picked up near the Syrian border about 10 days ago. The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir noted that the operation was conducted with the involvement of “foreign intelligence.” As Reuters reported, Baghdadi is believed to have three wives, ""two Iraqis and one Syrian.""

By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.
According to a security source quoted in AFP, ""the wife and child were taken to the defense ministry headquarters in Yarze, just outside the capital Beirut, 'where investigations were continuing.'"" The source added that the arrests had been kept under wraps so that security arrangements could be made.

It's unclear how useful these arrests will ultimately be, but they come as Lebanese authorities attempt to secure the release of 20 soldiers who are currently being held captive by Islamist groups. By some accounts, the capture of Baghdadi's wife and son provides the Lebanese government with a valuable bargaining chip.

This is already proving to be a bad week for ISIS. While the United States and Turkey had been rumored to be close to a deal to coordinate efforts against the Islamic State, on Tuesday, the Iraqi government reached a once-elusive agreement with the Kurds on both oil sharing and military cooperation in the campaign to fight ISIS.

Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who took over for the divisive Nuri al-Maliki, is receiving plaudits for his role in bringing the Kurds back into the fold and at least temporarily staving off a Kurdish push for independence."

"541","A South Korean newspaper has reported that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un underwent surgery to repair fractures in both ankles earlier this month.

The Chosun Ilbo report cited a source who had recently visited the North and claimed that the 31-year-old had undergone the operation at an exclusive hospital for high-ranking Communist Party members in Pyongyang. The source said that he had noticed a marked increase in the number of elite officials visiting the ward and said that bodyguards had been added as extra security.

Kim has not been seen in public since September 3, and his absence has prompted rampant speculation about his health. The whispers grew louder when he failed to attend a regular session of the Supreme People's Assembly last week. The rumors reached a fever pitch Thursday when North Korea's state-run television station showed the man it calls the ""Great Successor"" limping and admitted that he was feeling unwell, an extraordinary move for the tightly-controlled propaganda unit.

A South Korean intelligence official told the Chosun Ilbo that Kim had initially sprained his ankle over the summer during a tour of military bases and factories and aggravated the injury by not undergoing treatment immediately. Kim has noticeably gained weight since succeeding his father, Kim Jong-il in 2011 and is rumored to be suffering from various ailments, including gout, high cholesterol, obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure.

However, the South Korean intelligence official said that an attack of gout would not have been enough to keep him from the Supreme People's Assembly session, lending further credence to the surgery theory. The Chosun Ilbo had reported Monday that a team of doctors from France, Germany, and Russia had recently gone to North Korea.

"542","FEARS have been raised that Islamic State could target Britain with an EBOLA attack after two of the terror group's fighters reportedly contracted the deadly virus.

Sources at a hospital in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul say they have seen suspected cases involving two IS fighters.

They are believed to have unknowingly travelled from their African homelands with Ebola.

The news will spark fears that the jihadists could use the killer virus to hit Britain with so-called ""human-bug bombs"".

Intelligence experts have already urged authorities to be ready for members of the extremist outfit deliberately trying to spread Ebola in the West.

Even if a calculated plot does not emerge, experts fear Ebola could be accidentally spread by IS — also known as ISIS and ISIL — should it tear through the group's ranks.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) was last night scrambling to uncover more information about the Iraqi infection claims.

WHO officials have offered to assist the Iraqi government in investigating any potential outbreak.

However, experts are concerned that the lack of resources and doctors — caused by IS's bloody campaign in Syria and Iraq — could make cases impossible to probe and treat.

IS fighters have reportedly killed more than a dozen doctors, who may have been able to confirm the diagnoses, in Mosul.

Meanwhile Western medics, who would normally travel to the Middle East to help, face terrifying risks of kidnap and beheading by IS.

Ebola's potential appearance in Mosul was reported by three separate media outlets yesterday.

Mosul is 250 miles north of Baghdad and has been controlled by IS since June, 2014.

Al-Sabaah, an Iraqi newspaper, said two cases of Ebola and 26 of AIDS were reported in the city.

Citing medical sources, it claimed the virus had been transported from ""terrorists"" who came ""from several countries"" in Africa.

WHO director of communications Christy Feig said there has been ""no official notification"" from the Iraqi government that Ebola has been confirmed.

The organisation is trying to contact Iraqi officials to see if help can provided to investigate any suspected cases in rebel-controlled areas of the country.

Meanwhile a Kurdish official told media outlet Xendan the fighters’ symptoms were similar to those experienced by Ebola sufferers.

However, the effects of Ebola can resemble those caused by a number of illnesses, including malaria and Lassa and Yellow Fever.

They include nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, bleeding and bruising.

Middle East-based intelligence analyst Benjamin Decker said IS's killing of medics and its decision to ban Westerners from its territory could allow Ebola to spread rapidly.

He said: ""United Nations workers have thus far been prohibited from entering ISIS-controlled territory in both Iraq and Syria.

""In this context the lack of medical infrastructure, supplies and practitioners in the city suggests that the outbreak could quickly lead to further infection of both ISIS fighters and residents of Mosul.""

Hundreds of Britons are believed to have to travelled to join IS forces, with some already heading home.

Security and intelligence services monitor those who come back to see if they have renounced the terror network’s barbaric regime or whether they remain suspected terrorists plotting UK atrocities.

However, the current system may not equip security services for motoring symptoms of the Ebola, according to the WHO, has killed around 8,000 people in West Africa and affected areas so far.

IS is a hardline jihadist group, which formerly had ties to al-Qaeda.

It seized vest swathes of Iraq and Syria in August in a bid to create a so-called caliphate.

MacRumors reports that a newly discovered bug causes iCloud Drive documents to be permanently erased from the cloud whenever a a user picks ""Reset All Settings."" Ordinarily this option would simply do what it says; the iPhone's settings and preferences are immediately reset to their original factory defaults. No media (music, photos, etc.) or documents are supposed to be erased or otherwise affected when performing this action — that should only happen if you choose ""Erase All Content and Settings"" and wipe your phone entirely.

But something's clearly not right, with MacRumors reporting that documents stored in iCloud Drive are disappearing from Apple's iWork apps upon reset. They're also vanishing from OS X Yosemite, which will bring iCloud Drive to Mac users later this fall. Right now, it's iOS users along with Yosemite developers and beta testers reporting the problem. iCloud Drive is also available on Windows, but it's unclear if the issue has popped up there. It's also not yet obvious how widespread the bug is or whether it affects everyone that has transitioned to iCloud Drive.

In our own testing, using ""Reset All Settings"" deleted all iWork documents stored in iCloud Drive on the iPhone and on iCloud.com. After allowing time for syncing to a Mac running OS X Yosemite, all of the documents disappeared from that machine as well.

There's no easy way of recovering documents deleted from iCloud. Apple added a ""recently deleted"" folder to Photos in iOS 8, but hasn't yet implemented a similar option for all of iCloud. MacRumors notes the issue ""may be limited to Apple's own iWork apps like Pages, Keynote, and Numbers"" and iCloud Drive files from other third-party apps could be safe from the bug. But for now, the best option is avoiding ""Reset All Settings"" entirely until a fix is in place. We've reached out to Apple for clarification on just what's going on."
"546","American and British intelligence officials are eyeing a British-born rapper as the militant who beheaded journalist James Foley. 

A senior Western intelligence official told Fox News that 23-year-old London rapper Abdel Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect believed to be Foley's executioner. 

U.S. intelligence officials are not commenting publicly on the reports, but a well-placed source told Fox News that Bary's Egyptian-born father was extradited from London to the United States in 2012 for his alleged connection to Usama bin Laden and the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa.

Bary traveled to Syria last year to fight with  ISIS, the source said. 

The Sunday Times and Sunday People identified Bary as a member of a group of at least three British-born ISIS fighters known among former hostages as ""The Beatles.""

The Sunday Times reported that MI5 and MI6, Britain's two major intelligence agencies, had identified the man who did the brutal deed, though he had not been publicly identified.

A counterterrorism source told Fox News that the investigation was moving forward and slowly eliminating individuals of interest. The source also told Fox News that the FBI had opened a crisis file shortly after Foley was kidnapped in northern Syria in November 2012 that included signals intelligence and interviews with former hostages. 

The Sunday Mirror, citing British intelligence sources, identified two other suspects as 20-year-old Abu Hussain al-Britani, originally from Birmingham, and 23-year-old Abu Abduallah al-Britani (no known relation), originally from the county of Hampshire on England's south coast. 

The Mail on Sunday reported that the three men known as ""John,"" ""George,"" and ""Ringo"" had formed a special kidnapping gang that may have targeted Westerners like Foley. The paper reported that the hostages regarded the group as particularly vicious jailers, who routinely beat their prisoners and tortured them with Tasers. At one point, the paper reported, the ""Beatles"" were actually prohibited from guarding the hostages due to the level of violence they inflicted.

According to The Mail on Sunday, the ""Beatles"" also boasted that they had made millions of dollars from ransoms paid by European countries, enough to ""retire to Kuwait or Qatar,"" as one hostage told the paper. 

The U.S. and Britain have a policy of not paying ransom to terrorist groups in exchange for captured citizens. However, other Western countries have no such policy. The New York Times reported last month that Al Qaeda and its direct affiliates have received at least $125 million in ransom money since 2008, paid by European countries like France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, and Switzerland. 

Similarly, The Mail on Sunday reported that France had paid approximately $13.2 million for the release of four hostages held by ISIS earlier this year, while Italy had paid close to $5 million for the release of an Italian journalist. The release of seven other European journalists and aid workers reportedly cost a combined $26.5 million. Last week, the CEO of GlobalPost, a media organization where Foley had worked, revealed that ISIS had demanded a ransom of $132 million in exchange for Foley's release. 

In addition to Foley, ISIS is believed to be holding three other Americans hostage. One of them, journalist Steven Sotloff, is threatened with beheading by the militant known as ""John"" at the end of the video released last week.

""The MI5 investigation into the man behind James Foley's murder is ongoing but they have managed to identify the masked British jihadist who can be seen in the video holding a knife to his throat,"" the Sunday Times quoted a police source as saying.

Fox News reported that a ""senior Western intelligence official"" also confirmed that Bary is believed to be Foley's murderer, but U.S. intelligence officials are declining to comment.

Fox News said Bary's father was extradited from Great Britain to the U.S. in 2012 because of his connection with Osama bin Laden and the bombing of the U.S. Embassy bombings in Africa in 1998. A source told Fox that the younger Bary went to Syria in 2013 to fight on the side of ISIS.

The Mirror reported that Bary was performing hip-hop music under the name L Jinny before leaving his parent's home to fight in Syria. Friends of Bary told the Mirror that the performer was radicalized from the teachings of preacher Anjem Choudary.

""He had the talent,"" one of his friends told the Mirror. ""He could have been as big as Dizzee Rascal. He was doing music with huge names in the underground scene. People have got into his head. It's transformed a talented young guy into a vengeful extremist.""

The Mirror reported that Abu Hussain Al-Britani, 20, a computer hacker from Birmingham, and Abu Abdullah al-Britani, 23, from Portsmouth, are also being investigated.

A source told the Mirror that a team of soldiers are on the ground in Iraq and Syria looking to catch Foley's killer within the next few days. The source also said that British intelligence services believe it has a good beat on the identity of the British-born ""Jihadi John"" and manhunt efforts will turn him up."
"552","Computing giant Microsoft is one of the Silicon Valley companies that has hired robot security guards to protect and serve the streets around northern California's technology hub.

The Knightscope K5 robot security guards are fitted with lasers, GPS and heat-detecting technology, and can predict where criminals will strike next and the likelihood of future crimes.

Unlike human security guards, the egg-like Knightscopes are not armed(Knightscope)

The 5ft tall robots are designed to operate without human control and are equipped with surveillance cameras and sensors, a thermal imaging system, scanners that can read 300 car registration plates a minute, and odour detectors. It patrols the streets using lasers to gauge distance and a GPS system.

The robots analyse information from government, businesses and social media sources to predict the likelihood of a crime being committed in a given area, and decide whether the alert authorities it if comes across anything suspicious.

Four of the robot security guards have been deployed to guard Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus, in the system's first real mission.

It appears to be going well, although the robots have come unstuck in the face of a seemingly innocent adversary: steps.

Rachel Metz, a reporter for MIT Technology Review, said: ""I noticed that a K5 in the distance had somehow toppled over the edge of the sidewalk onto the parking-lot asphalt several inches below. A couple of Knightscope folks were needed to pull it upright.""

Well, if Doctor Who's mortal enemies can't handle stairs, what chance to these youngsters have?

"553","News of guitarist Willie Nelson’s death spread quickly earlier this week causing concern among fans across the world. However the February 2015 report has now been confirmed as a complete hoax and just the latest in a string of fake celebrity death reports. Thankfully, the guitarist best known for hit songs like To All the Girls I've Loved Before or Pancho and Lefty is alive and well.

UPDATE 24/02/2015 : This story seems to be false. (read more)

Willie Nelson death hoax spreads on Facebook

Rumors of the guitarist’s alleged demise gained traction on Sunday after a ‘R.I.P. Willie Nelson’ Facebook page attracted nearly one million of ‘likes’. Those who read the ‘About’ page were given a believable account of the American guitarist’s passing:

“At about 11 a.m. ET on Sunday (February 22, 2015), our beloved guitarist Willie Nelson passed away. Willie Nelson was born on April 30, 1933 in Abbott. He will be missed but not forgotten. Please show your sympathy and condolences by commenting on and liking this page.”
Hundreds of fans immediately started writing their messages of condolence on the Facebook page, expressing their sadness that the talented 81-year-old guitarist and singer was dead. And as usual, Twittersphere was frenzied over the death hoax.

Where as some trusting fans believed the post, others were immediately skeptical of the report, perhaps learning their lesson from the huge amount of fake death reports emerging about celebrities over recent months. Some pointed out that the news had not been carried on any major American network, indicating that it was a fake report, as the death of a guitarist of Willie Nelson's stature would be major news across networks.

A recent poll conducted for the Celebrity Post shows that a large majority (90%) of respondents think those Willie Nelson death rumors are not funny anymore.

Willie Nelson Death Hoax Dismissed Since Guitarist Is ‘Alive And Well’

On Monday (February 23) the guitarist's reps officially confirmed that Willie Nelson is not dead. “He joins the long list of celebrities who have been victimized by this hoax. He's still alive and well, stop believing what you see on the Internet,” they said.

Some fans have expressed anger at the fake report saying it was reckless, distressing and hurtful to fans of the much loved guitarist. Others say this shows his extreme popularity across the globe.

"554","Swiss cheese, Cuban heels and a gruelling political schedule have been blamed for Communist leader's injury

Video loading

North Korea dictator Kim Jong-un has undergone a hospital operation after he fractured both ankles.

The 20-stone leader of one of the world’s most impoverished countries has soared on the scales due to his love of fine wine and dining.

Kim, believed to be aged 31, is under armed guard by his personal protection team at a hospital in North Korea’s capital, Pyongyang.

One source in South Korea’s Seoul said there had been a marked increase in elite officials visiting the ward after Kim’s official car did not appear to have left Pyongyang in recent weeks.

Kim is believed to have sprained then fractured his ankles during a gruelling tour of military bases and factories in shoes with Cuban heels to give him a little more height and a physical appearance of more authority.

Painful: Kim Jong-un is believed to insist on wearing Cuban heels for official duty to appear more of an authoritarian

The 31-year-old leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while studying in Switzerland and imports vast quantities despite Western sanctions.

One intelligence source said: “He has become noticeably overweight since he came to power.”

Kim was seen limping when he visited a government establishment in a clip shown on North Korea’s Central TV.

There were earlier suggestions Kim’s obesity and binge drinking had brought on gout which confined him behind closed doors for several days.

But aides were determined to turn his health problems to good advantage, with the official Rodong Sinmun daily newspaper saying he had “laboured on” by visiting various facilities in the hot summer weather.

Kim even missed a regular session of the Supreme People’s Assembly in Pyongyang last Thursday fuelling belief he was still confined to hospital.

Craving: The North Korean leader's love of cheese has led to rapid weight gain

A Seoul government official said it was unlikely “a young man like Kim Jong-un would have missed the Supreme People’s Assembly just because he has gout.”

His absence from the assembly was followed by a rare admission by state TV, which not only showed footage of him limping but also stated that he was ill.

A team of doctors from Europe is also believed to have travelled to North Korea recently.

A political observer said ""coming down closer to the level of his people"" was the only way Kim was going to return to health, beat his gout, lose weight and prevent a repeat of his reported fractured ankles.

Malnutrition is widespread in North Korea, with famines often breaking out in a country still relying on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s.

"555","Have you ever had your picture taken at an… unfortunate moment? Or worse yet, been caught on video when it really looked like you were doing something you weren’t? It doesn’t entirely matter what the confusion is, so much as people’s willingness to assume the worst, which is precisely what happened to a veteran meteorologist on national television over the weekend. But now, anchor Brian Williams has leapt in to save the day — he explained that NBC meteorologist Mike Seidel wasn’t peeing in the snow while on-air with Lester Holt, despite how it may have looked, and he called for an apology for the confusion.

Seidel is no stranger to inclement and chaotic weather, as he’s been reporting out of extreme conditions for years. In this case, he was in the thick of a storm in North Carolina when, according to Williams, he lost his cell phone connection to the NBC studio, and thus didn’t realize he was live on-camera. And while he took off his gloves and fiddled with his phone to call them back, turned away from the camera, it painted a very particular picture — basically, it kinda looked like he was pissing in the snow, and that was all it took for social media to explode.


Social media owes our friend Mike Seidel an apology. The intrepid and fearless Weather Channel meteorologist was the victim of some wild misinformation when this happened on the news here Saturday night. … that’s when the rumors hit that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow.
Of course, Williams is well-known to be a good sport with a decent sense of humor, so one hopes his request for an apology for Seidel isn’t too stern. Though really, it wouldn’t much help if it was — he’s calling for “social media” to apologize, after all, so good luck with that. Nor would it have been a big deal if he actually had been, ahem, “writing his name in the snow.” Because believe it or not, everybody has to go now and then, even the people on the TV. They’re just like us!


Notwithstanding however, Williams, NBC (and Seidel himself, one assumes) wanted to clear the air about this humble mix-up, and that’s all well and good. Unfortunately, it does steal away basically all the replay value of that misunderstood footage, though. If I wanted to watch somebody struggle to make a phone call with their back to me, I’d… well, I wouldn’t! Because I don’t want to see that, I just want to see weather reporters sneakily peeing in snow drifts. Is that so much to ask?

"557","Protesters march in support of the girls kidnapped by members of Boko Haram in front of the Nigerian Embassy in Washington on May 6.

The Nigerian government said Friday that it reached a cease-fire agreement with Boko Haram, the jihadist organization that kidnapped 219 girls in April, according to the AFP.

“A ceasefire agreement has been concluded between the Federal Government of Nigeria and Boko Haram,” said Air Marshal Alex Badeh, Nigeria’s top military officer.

A second Nigerian official told AFP that the ceasefire would include provisions for the release of the kidnapped girls.

“They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,” said Hassan Tukur, a secretary to President Goodluck Jonathan who served as the government’s representative in talks with Boko Haram.

But some experts questioned the credibility of the officials’ claims, in part because news of the agreement comes as President Jonathan prepares to launch a re-election bid. Announcing the return of the girls, whose abduction inspired the hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, could help Jonathan’s electoral aspirations — even if the claim turns out not to be entirely true.

The Nigerian government has lied about the girls several times in the past. The government even once claimed to have rescued the girls.

In particular, experts questioned the credibility of Danladi Ahmadu, who the government said was Boko Haram’s representative in the talks.

“I have never heard of Ahmadu, and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group’s leader Abubakar Shekau,” Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government, told AFP.

The Nigerian military has been fighting Boko Haram since 2009. Multiple attempts at reaching a cease-fire have proven unsuccessful."
"559","Two Aussie mates had to be talked out of the gnarly honour of eating what they claim is the world's oldest burger, which they bought at an Adelaide McDonald's 20 years ago.

According to the pair, Casey Dean, then 14, and 13-year-old Eduard Nitz stopped off at their local restaurant in the mid-90s to pick up some burgers.

In the order was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they had bought for a friend.

He never turned up, instead asking the pair to keep it safe for when he was in the city next.

Now 20 years later, it remains under lock and key and bears an uncanny resemblance to its far fresher contemporaries.

""We're pretty sure it's the oldest burger in the world,"" Mr Dean said.

""It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we'd hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

""The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.""

The pair showed off the mould-free specimen on The Project tonight, teasing that they might take a bite after all these years in the name of charity.

But common sense prevailed when the show’s hosts protested, and they left the decades-old meal for another day.

UPDATED: OK, we’re somehow supposed to live on earth eating sandwiches and believing that a man who walks like Paul Rudd, wears Paul Rudd’s face and (we assume) quacks like Paul Rudd is not actually Paul Rudd.

Vanity Fair reached out to the actor’s reps, who denied that the man in the video was Rudd. We’re calling shenanigans, because superheroes never want their true identities revealed.

So, update — wink wink, nudge nudge — the man in the video is definitely not Paul Rudd. Either that, or we have a much bigger clone problem on our hands than we initially assumed.

—

EARLIER: Look, we’ve always suspected that Paul Rudd was a super nice guy. While we would normally be suspicious of someone who doesn’t age (seriously, take a look at “Clueless” and then remember that was 19 years ago), his adorable stories about teenage kegger antics, being too ripped for his “Ant-Man” costume and punnily helping people announce their impending offspring help keep those suspicions at bay.

And now a new video, coupled with a little bit of investigative Twitter journalism (twournalism), really drives the point home, hard. Recently a unnamed man went on a homophobic rant at the Dallas airport, eventually trying to get violent with the man he was yelling at. As he lashed out, a group of passers by tackled him and pinned him to the ground, restraining him until police could come and handcuff him. And guess what! One of those randos was none other than Paul Rudd.

Yep, keep an eye out for him in a blue checked shirt and olive-colored jacket, jumping on and holding the dude down. Wonkette has the backstory of how we figured out it was Ant-Man himself.

Just add this incident to the growing list of reasons we suspect Rudd is an actual superhero."
"562","Investment firm Piper Jaffray issued a report on Monday breaking down expected Apple Watch average selling prices, saying an aggregate of consumers will likely spend closer to $550 on the device, considering case and internal storage options.

Building off Apple's quoted starting price of $349, analyst Gene Munster anticipates combined Apple Watch ASPs to fall closer to $550, or $575 to $600 including additional bands.

Apple Watch will come in three separate price tiers — Apple Watch Sport, Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition — each series including two display sizes and a variety of strap choices.

Starting with Apple Watch Sport, the aluminum and glass version widely thought to be the least expensive model, Munster expects an ASP of $450 after factoring in configuration alternatives like case and internal storage options.

The stainless steel Apple Watch model, which also features a more expensive sapphire glass cover, is expected to start at $499 to $549, again depending on customizable features. Munster sees an overall ASP at around $650 for the mid-tier Watch series.

On the high end, the analyst forecasts base model Apple Watch Edition devices to start at $4,999, but classifies segment ASP closer to $7,500 after adding in straps made from precious metals.

Based on current pricing for Apple's silicon iPhone 6 cases, which come in at $35, Munster sees elastomer Apple Watch straps to start in a similar $29 to $35 range, while leather bands could be priced between $49 to $59. Pricing for metal bands like the link bracelet and Milanese loop are more difficult to determine, but the analyst believes steel versions will come in at $99, while gold bands could be priced into the thousands of dollars.

""If you assume that 55 percent of bands purchased are elastomer, 35 percent leather, 10 percent steel, and about 5,000 total gold bands are sold, the average band ASP could be around $50,"" Munster writes.

He added that if half of all Watch buyers purchase a band — assuming 8 million Watches are sold in 2015 — the accessory range would add $25 to Apple's watch category, equating to a $575 ASP. If every Watch customer purchases an extra strap, it would tack on $50, bringing ASP up to $600.

The lower-cost Sport model is expected to make up 55 percent of overall Watch sales, while the mid-tier Apple Watch will take another 45 percent. That leaves very little room for Apple Watch Edition, but Munster believes Apple might sell roughly 10,000 units this year. In an interesting comparison, the firm calculates that Apple Watch Edition business could equate to about two percent of luxury watchmaker Rolex, which moves between 600,000 to 750,000 units each year.

Finally, Munster expects Apple to reveal a better sense of device pricing at its March 9 event, as well as highlight ""special features"" to drum up consumer interest ahead of release.

AppleInsider will be covering the ""Spring forward"" event live from San Francisco's Yerba Buena Center next week."
"564","The gunman in a fatal shooting that rocked Ottawa on Wendesday has been identified.

Canadian officials told the AP that the shooter, who killed a soldier and wounded two other people near the Canadian Parliament building, is Michael Zehaf-Bibeau.

Zehaf-Bibeau, 32, was from Quebec and had recently converted to Islam, U.S. sources told Reuters. According to the Globe and Mail, he had been designated a ""high-risk traveler"" by Canadian officials and was barred from traveling outside the country.

After police chased him inside the Parliament building, Zehaf-Bibeau was killed by Sgt. at Arms Kevin Vickers.

Witnesses told the AP that Zehaf-Bibeau was wearing a scarf over his face when he opened fire in front of the Canadian War Memorial, which is across the street from Parliament.

The Canadian Broadcast Company released an image purported to be of the gunman:

BREAKING | This is a photo of Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, gunman in this morning's shootings in Ottawa. #cbcOTT #OTTnews pic.twitter.com/OLSxlYPelj

— CBC Ottawa (@CBCOttawa) October 22, 2014

An Ottawa police spokesman told HuffPost that the police were looking for at least one other suspect. However, in a press conference later on Wednesday, officials declined to say if there were multiple possible shooters.

Wednesday's shooting quickly sparked terrorism fears. Just two days earlier, a Quebec man suspected of ties to radical Islam killed one soldier and wounded another with his car before being killed by police. As Reuters pointed out, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, the attacker, was one of 90 people being monitored by Canadian national police over extremist beliefs.

Earlier this month, NBC News reported that the Canadian government was monitoring ""hundreds of people"" that it suspected could be planning to join ISIS. Anonymous officials told NBC that they were aware of several threats from ISIS supporters, but they said that none were substantial."

In December, the message was lost during a service upgrade, which left the 68-year-old Brit ""absolutely devastated"" and also ""extremely angry,"" according to the BBC. So he contacted Virgin Media to see if they could retrieve it and -- with the help of nearly a dozen engineers -- they did.

The virus, which has claimed thousands of lives in West Africa, is believed to have been brought to the city by jihadists from several different countries.

WHO spokesman Christy Feig confirmed that the health agency is reaching out to ISIS officials in the region to gather more information, The Daily Mail noted on Friday. Feig said that the Iraqi government hasn't yet responded to the news of possible Ebola cases in the country.

ISIS Executes Nearly 2,000 People in Syria in Six Months

An unconfirmed number of jihadists apparently sought treatment at the hospital in Mosul, which was captured by ISIS earlier this year. Local newspaper al Sabaah has claimed that the virus was brought to Mosul by terrorists arriving from several countries in Africa.

As of the end of 2014, the total death count from the largest Ebola outbreak in history stands at 7,890 people, while over 20,000 have been diagnosed with the disease, for which there is no cure.

The West African countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone have been the hardest hit. While the former two have seen the transmission rate go down significantly in the past couple of months, Sierra Leone remains in a fierce battle to contain the virus.

ISIS captured several cities across Iraq and Syria in 2014, and has been seeking to establish an Islamic caliphate in the region.

Confirmation of Ebola cases will likely be difficult, however, as U.N. workers are prohibited from entering militant-controlled areas.

The militants have become known for executing prisoners, including women and children, and giving Christians and other religious minorities an option to convert to Islam, pay a tax or be killed. Over a dozen doctors have reportedly been executed by ISIS in recent weeks for refusing to treat their injured fighters.

The Daily Mail pointed out that there is no information on whether doctors still working in Mosul are trained or equipped to fight a possible Ebola outbreak.

Since Ebola shares symptoms with other diseases including malaria and yellow fever, it is also possible that the cases so far have been misdiagnosed.

It is also not know how many fighters from West African countries could have joined ISIS, though tens of thousands of foreigners and several other jihadist groups have reportedly rallied under the Islamic State banner.

Nigerian terror group Boko Haram also pledged allegiance to ISIS in 2014 — Nigeria experienced its own scare with Ebola after a number of cases of the virus were reported, but the country was declared Ebola-free by October."

"569","If you needed another reason to hate Comcast, the most hated company in America, they’ve just given it to you: they’ve declared war on Tor Browser.
Reports have surfaced (Via /r/darknetmarkets and another one submitted to us) that Comcast agents have contacted customers using Tor and instructed them to stop using the browser or risk termination of service. A Comcast agent named Jeremy allegedly called Tor an “illegal service.” The Comcast agent told its customer that such activity is against usage policies.
The Comcast agent then repeatedly asked the customer to tell him what sites he was accessing on the Tor browser. The customer refused to answer.
The next day the customer called Comcast and spoke to another agent named Kelly who reiterated that Comcast does not want its customers using Tor. The Comcast agent then allegedly told the customer:
Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate,   fine, or suspend your account at anytime due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.
How did Comcast know its customers were using Tor in the first place? Because Tor Browser provides online anonymity to its users,  This would mean that Comcast is monitoring the online activities of its users, to (among other things) check if they are following their Acceptable Use Policy.
Comcast has previously been listed by the Tor project as a Bad ISP. The users of the Tor project listed Comcast as a bad ISP that is not friendly to Tor. The Tor project cited Comcast’s Acceptable Use Policy for its residential customers which claims to not allow servers or proxies under “technical restrictions.”:
use or run dedicated, stand-alone equipment or servers from the Premises that provide network content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (“PremisesLAN”), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy services and servers;
A Comcast spokesperson told DeepDotWeb that:
We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.
However, this statement appears to be at odds with Comcast’s treatment of Ross Ulbricht, alleged Dread Pirate Roberts.
Comcast previously corroborated with the FBI by providing information on alleged Silk Road mastermind Ross Ulbricht’s internet usage. Ulbricht’s legal defense without a warrant. Ulbricht was most certainly never given a warning by Comcast or given time to contact a lawyer before he was arrested in a San Francisco library last October.
Comcast already monitors its customers internet usage to prevent them from downloading pirated media in violation of copyright laws. Under the “Six Strikes” plan, Comcast customers who are caught by Comcast pirating copy-written material are emailed by Comcast and told to cease the activity. Comcast will continue monitoring them, and if they violate the “Six Strikes” plan five more times, their internet service will be terminated.

"570","You want a gold Apple Watch, you say? Then it's going to cost you... a lot. 

The vanilla variant of Apple's newest wrist-worn wearable device only costs $349. However, if you're willing to spend big cash on something that has the Apple logo on it, the company would be more than willing to accommodate. 

According to analyst John Gruber, the gold version of the upcoming device may cost about as much as the monthly salary of a middle-class worker in the United States. Gruber predicts that the gold Apple Watch would cost $5,000. The figure is basically just a guess. However, it's not an uneducated one. 

""Most people think I'm joking when I say the gold ones are going to start at $5,000. I couldn't be more serious,"" Gruber wrote in a blog post. ""The lowest conceivable price I could see for the Edition models is $1,999 -- but the gold alone, just as scrap metal, might in fact be worth more than that.""

Gruber claims that Apple told him that the gold version of the Apple Watch is made of solid 18-karat gold. It is not gold-plated. This caused him to revise his guess on the price of the device.  

He based his estimate on the going rate for solid gold watches from other manufacturers. Challenging people to find a solid gold watch that costs less than $20,000, he cited a leaked price list for Rolex from 2012. Luxury watch companies don't set prices for their products; they leave that to their authorized dealers. This means that the products on the price list may have ended up being sold for a higher price. In the list, an 18-karat gold Rolex had a price tag of $34,250.


Gruber suspects that the reason Apple has been mostly silent about the specs for the device is that they don't know what the capabilities of the finished product would be. 

""What does Apple Watch actually do? Or, rather, what does WatchKit allow? We don't know. And Apple is not talking, even off the record. One factor is that the software (and perhaps the hardware internals remain a work in progress). It is far from a finished product,"" he said. 

Aside from the gold version, Gruber also predicts a stainless steel version of the device that costs $999. It's not clear whether fancier variants of the device would be available with the sport version at launch. Nonetheless, the Apple Watch is expected to ship in early 2015."

"572","As a feel-good video of a generous homeless man continues to touch and move millions around the world, a California man has come forward to claim that the Internet prankster behind it faked a significant portion of the film, confirming our earlier suspicions.

In the video released last week, YouTube star Josh Paler Lin purports to give a homeless man named Thomas $100 and then secretly follow him around to see how he spends it. Thomas walks right into a liquor store. But instead of alcohol, the homeless man defies expectations and walks out with a couple of bags of food, then heads to a nearby park and starts giving it away to other people down on their luck. Apparently moved by the selfless act, Lin confronts Thomas and tells him that he’s being filmed.

Uploaded By: JoshPalerLin

As of Tuesday morning, the video had racked up more than 27 million views on YouTube and inspired more than 150 glowing news articles from around the world. Following its success, Lin launched an Indiegogo fundraising campaign to “help Thomas get a fresh start,” which has netted more than $127,000 in well-meaning donations from the public.

But now a nursing student from Anaheim has come forward to say there’s no way Thomas could have been secretly filmed—because he and Lin arrived at the liquor store in the same car. “The whole thing is bullshit,” says Taugan Tan Kadalim, who claims that on Dec. 20 he was outside the Euclid Liquor & Market, where the video’s pivotal scene is set. “Thomas knew he was being followed.”

The 26-year-old says he stopped at the store to buy a lottery ticket before picking up his girlfriend, who lives in an apartment complex directly across the street. As he was walking out of the liquor store, Kadalim says he spotted Lin sitting in the driver’s seat of a nearby vehicle and recognized him immediately from his previous prank videos. “I was like, ‘Oh my God, it’s him,” says Kadalim, adding that he subscribed to Lin’s YouTube channel. “I couldn’t believe it.”

A cameraman sat in the passenger seat of Lin’s car, and behind him was the man who Kadalim would later recognize as Thomas, the homeless Samaritan Lin claims was secretly followed with a hidden camera. Thinking the three men were about shoot a prank video, Kadalim decided to stick around and watch.

What Kadalim says happened next is sure to disappoint many of the millions of viewers who have been touched by the video.

According to Kadalim, Lin hopped out of the car, went inside the liquor store and spoke with the cashier. While the two men chatted inside, Thomas waited with his bag by Lin’s car. Eventually, the prankster returned to his car, and a few minutes later, Thomas wandered into the liquor store. Several calls to Euclid Liquor & Market to confirm Kadalim’s account went unanswered.

“That was the last thing I remember seeing,” Kadalim says.

In the actual video, Thomas appears to be followed from a distance for several blocks, and as he enters the store, Lin says to his cameraman, “Keep filming. Make sure he doesn’t see you.”

Kadalim says he immediately fired off a text message about the sighting to his brother, a fellow YouTube prank enthusiast. He shared the text with Vocativ, and the date and time stamps appear to match up. Kadalim’s girlfriend, who spoke on the condition that we not use her name, also corroborates the account.

“He told me that he had just run into some famous YouTube star while buying a lotto ticket,” she tells Vocativ. “Don couldn’t wait to watch the video.”

But when Kadalim did see the video, released on Dec. 22, he was floored.

“Bro, he drove Thomas to the liquor store,” he says. “While I think the guy is homeless, it is clear that from what I saw every part of that scene was staged.”

Upset, Kadalim called his girlfriend and his brother to tell them what happened. As the video started to go viral just before Christmas, he posted a comment to Lin’s YouTube channel explaining what he witnessed. His words, however, were quickly buried beneath an outpouring of praise as thousands left comments in support of the video.

“I’m not frustrated because he’s helping a homeless man and people love this video,” he says. “I’m frustrated because it’s dishonest and exploitive.”

Prior to Kadalim’s revelation, Lin told Vocativ that not a single scene had been staged or scripted. “There is no way we’re making any of this up,” he said. “This is real.”

Subsequent attempts to reach Lin for further comment on Kadalim’s accusations were unsuccessful.

After the video went viral, Lin told us previously that he plucked Thomas from the homeless shelter where he’d been staying and put him up in a hotel, the name of which Lin would not disclose. Lin has also refused all media requests to speak with Thomas, and he denied repeated requests from Vocativ to make Thomas available for an interview. At the same time, he’s been busy producing more videos starring the homeless man, including this “Xmas Surprise Makeover,” released Sunday.

Lin also informed us that he has at least one more major media event in the works, in which he plans to surprise Thomas with all of the money that’s been raised for him on Indiegogo. Asked how the public could be certain those funds would actually go to Thomas, Lin told us that his lawyers, agent and manager have everything “covered.” When asked for the names of his lawyers, agent and manager, Lin refused to provide them, claiming they are “confidential.” He also declined to let any of them speak with Vocativ."
"573","Thirty-year-old Dimitry Nikolaev, a married Russian television actor, was having a drink at a bar in Moscow after a theater performance when an attractive, blonde woman approached him. The unidentified woman invited him to accompany her to a sauna where, according to police reports, they drank beer and kissed before he blacked out. 

The next morning, Dimitry woke up at a bus stop to find that his phone, wallet, and testicles had all been stolen. He was rushed to the hospital, where doctors informed him that the procedure must have been done by someone with medical knowledge, as the surgery was done skillfully and his sack was carefully sewn up again following the removal of his nuts. Police therefore believe this was probably a result of organ trafficking, as opposed to a vindictive crime. 

Russian newspaper Life News reports that the actor is having trouble figuring out how to explain the situation to his wife, and for now is simply telling her he is at the hospital for a ""serious illness."" Though given that the story is all over the media, it's likely she's learned the truth by now."
"574","Apple is reportedly relying on Samsung’s chip-building talents to mass-produce the brand-new chip in the Apple Watch as the device’s launch nears. The S1 system-in-package (SiP) that Apple was mostly secretive about during the smartwatch’s introduction contains various other components on top of Samsung’s chip, including mobile DRAM, NAND flash, and other peripheral chips, with Advanced Semiconductor Engineering providing the SiP modules.

FROM EARLIER: It looks like Samsung is finally developing a worthy rival for the Apple Watch and Moto 360

According to Digitimes’ sources, Samsung has won orders from Apple to make some 3,000 to 4,000 12-inch wafers each month, using its 28nm process technology, with the Apple Watch expected to launch at some point in March.

The Apple Watch is expected to become another important revenue source for Apple, though analysts disagree on the device’s sales performance in its first year. Some expect Apple to sell an impressive number of smartwatches by converting plenty of existing iOS users into first-gen Apple Watch buyers.

Samsung is reportedly making a secret new chip in the Apple WatchSamsung is reportedly making a secret new chip in the Apple Watch

Digitimes says that others have revised downward the number for first-gen Apple Watch shipments to as low as 10 million units for 2015, although they seem to be more optimistic on the device’s second-generation model that will presumably offer stronger battery life and other important improvements."
"577","French Apple website iGen.fr is reporting [Google Translate] that pricing for the stainless steel Apple Watch may start at $500, while the gold Apple Watches' pricing could start between $4,000 and $5,000. iGen.fr has been reliable in the past, most recently reporting the dimensions of both the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.

While Apple had announced that the Apple Watch would start at $350, which was widely assumed to be the price of the aluminum model, and estimates pegged the price of the gold Apple Watch at prices as low as $1,000 or as high as $5,000, there has been little information regarding the pricing of the stainless steel option.

The site's sources also indicate that Apple still aims to release the Apple Watch by Valentine's Day 2015, which somewhat echoes an earlier report that said the company would be ""lucky"" to release the device by that timeframe. iGen.fr also mentions that manufacturers and resellers are preparing as if the Watch would release in mid-February 2015. Previously, Apple Senior Vice President of Retail and Online Stores Angela Ahrendts said the Watch would release in Spring 2015."

The Lede: Investigation Suggests American Journalist Missing in Syria Is ‘Likely’ Held by GovernmentMAY 3, 2013
Titled “A Message to America,” the video shows the journalist kneeling in a desert landscape, clad in an orange jumpsuit — an apparent reference to the uniforms worn by prisoners at the American military detention camp in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. Standing to his left is a masked ISIS fighter, who begins speaking in English, with what sounds like an East London accent. Pulling out a knife, he says that Mr. Foley’s execution is in retaliation for the recent American airstrikes ordered by President Obama against the extremist group in Iraq.

“I call on my friends, family and loved ones to rise up against my real killers — the U.S. government — for what will happen to me is only a result of their complacent criminality,” Mr. Foley says in the video, which was uploaded to the online account of the al-Furqan Media Foundation, according to SITE, an organization that follows jihadist groups. He ends saying that when American soldiers began dropping bombs on Iraq this month, “they signed my death certificate.”

On Tuesday night, Mr. Foley’s mother, Diane Foley, issued a statement on the Facebook page the family had created to publicize their son’s disappearance: “We have never been prouder of our son Jim. He gave his life trying to expose the world to the suffering of the Syrian people. We implore the kidnappers to spare the lives of the remaining hostages. Like Jim, they are innocents. They have no control over American government policy in Iraq, Syria or anywhere in the world.”

Two weeks ago, in the wake of American-led airstrikes against the terrorist group, which was fanning out across Iraq, jihadists had taken to social media to call for attacks on American interests. In the three hours after the graphic video of Mr. Foley’s beheading was uploaded on YouTube, jihadists using the hashtag “#NewMessageFromISIStoUS” surpassed 2,000 tweets, according to a survey by SITE, with many fighters gloating over his death, and calling it just retribution for the air raids.

Mr. Foley, 40, a freelance journalist who was working for GlobalPost, an online publication based in Boston, as well as for Agence France-Presse, disappeared in Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He was held alongside several other Americans, whose families have asked for a news blackout.

The video concludes with the fighter threatening to kill Steven Sotloff, another American freelance journalist, who was being held alongside Mr. Foley. Mr. Sotloff is seen kneeling in the same position, in the same landscape and wearing the same style of orange-colored jumpsuit. “The life of this American citizen, Obama, depends on your next decision,” the fighter says.

Mr. Obama was briefed about the video by Benjamin J. Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser, on Air Force One as he returned to Martha’s Vineyard, according to Eric Schultz, the deputy White House press secretary.

In Washington, a National Security Council spokeswoman, Caitlin Hayden, said in a statement: “We have seen a video that purports to be the murder of U.S. citizen James Foley by ISIL. The intelligence community is working as quickly as possible to determine its authenticity. If genuine, we are appalled by the brutal murder of an innocent American journalist,” she said, using an alternative name for ISIS.

Reached by telephone, Philip Balboni, the chief executive and a founder of GlobalPost, said that the newsroom and Mr. Foley’s family were also trying to establish the veracity of the footage. “We are still evaluating the video at this time,” he said.

Mr. Foley, who was last seen in Binesh, Syria, was also abducted in Libya in 2011, where he was held for several weeks after running into troops loyal to Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s crumbling government.

He was among dozens of journalists — many of them freelancers without the formal backing of a news organization — who disappeared in 2012 and 2013 in Syria.

It is believed the 32-year-old, who celebrated his birthday last week, is considering building a joint in Scotland, fuelled by the quest for independence north of the border and the communist country’s love of whisky.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch blog, claimed Kim is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

“It would not surprise me at all if they opened a restaurant in Scotland”
Michael Madden
He said: “It would not surprise me at all if they opened a restaurant in Scotland.

“The Scottish independence referendum catapulted the country into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

“Despite voting ‘No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky.”

It would be the second North Korean government restaurant to open in Europe after one popped up in Amsterdam in 2012.

The food outlets channel 30% of their takings back to the capital Pyongyang but critics think the cash will be trousered by Kim to fund his own lavish lifestyle.

As well as being hooked on whisky, Kim is addicted to Swiss Emmental cheese, which is partly to blame for his huge weight gain.

It is claimed he imports vast quantities of the fatty treat into North Korea at huge expense despite millions of his countrymen living in abject poverty.

Mr Madden said: “The restaurants are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

“They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run but they tailor the menus to suit.”

North Korea expert Jenny Town said she believed the country has “warmed” to Scotland in recent months.

She added: “North Korea is going to support any country that is struggling for independence as it continues to seek validation and recognition of its own legitimacy.”

"583","Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary has reportedly been identified the ISIS militant who beheaded American journalist James Foley in a video released this week.

Reports over the last several days had indicated that British intelligence forces were focusing in on the 23-year-old former London resident, who had achieved some fame in the UK for his rap career. Sources say that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary left his family’s upscale home in London last year to join ISIS.

Bary is believed to have traveled to Syria, and recently tweeted a picture of himself holding a severed head.

Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary had a somewhat successful rap career, with some of his songs earning play on BBC radio. In early songs he made references to drug use and violence, as well as the threat of his family being deported to Egypt. His father, Adel Abdul Bary, was extradited from Britain to the United States on charges of terrorism in 2012 and was believed to be a close lieutenant of Osama bin Laden.

“It’s hard to progress in the future with a damaged past but still I try to count my blessings and I thank Allah,” he rapped in 2012.

“I’m trying to change my ways but there’s blood on my hands and I can’t change my ways until there’s funds in the bank.

“I can’t differentiate the angels from the demons, my heart’s disintegrating. I ain’t got normal feelings.

“Even my life’s blessed, still I will not find rest.”

In the James Foley beheading video, a masked executioner with a British accent read a statement warning the United States not to enter the conflict. The man later severed Foley’s neck with a knife and cut off is head.

Experts believe that British forces had likely identified Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary not long after the video was released.

Professor Peter Neumann, director of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College London, said authorities were likely quite familiar with the British suspect.

He said: “I’d be very surprised if they haven’t already narrowed it down to a small group of people.

“The video provides enough clues to show who is responsible. MI6 probably do have a rough idea already of where the hostages are. The intelligence agencies probably have it narrowed down to two or three people.”

British intelligence has not officially confirmed that Abdel-Majed Abdel Bary is the suspect in the James Foley beheading."

"587","The show was a global hit and Jess Smith became one of the most famous faces in the world - but for 19 years only her family ever knew it was her

Does Jess Smith look familiar? If so, it's probably because she's still recognisable as the Teletubbies sun baby - almost 20 years after she starred in the kids' show.

After 19 years, the student has finally broken her silence and outed herself as the the baby face in mega-popular children's TV show.

She was selected to be the giggling baby sun, who looks over Teletubbyland at the age of nine months.

The show was a global hit and Jess, now 19, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family ever knew it was her.

There were even rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Jess has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her iconic role in the TV show, which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Jess only revealed her secret past during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Jess said: ""I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them.

""My mother is really chuffed.""

The first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: ""So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

""I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

""I am the sun from Teletubbies.

""There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.""

Sensation: The Teletubbies gang Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po

Jess added: ""I am really happy, cheerful and giggly. When I told my friends they said they could see me in the sun baby face.""

Jess' name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Jess was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her furniture deliver father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: ""It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

""They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.

""We didn't hear anything until we got a letter when she was 18 months old saying she'd been picked.

"588","UK Prime Minister David Cameron denounced the Islamic State (IS) jihadist organisation as “monsters” Sunday after the Foreign Office said a video showing the murder of a British aid worker appeared to be authentic.

""All the signs are that the video is genuine, we have no reason to believe that it's not,"" a spokesman for the Foreign Office told AFP.

The video showing the beheading of David Haines, who was abducted in Syria last year, was released by IS militants late Saturday. It was the third beheading of a Western hostage by the group in less than a month.

After chairing a meeting of the government's emergency Cobra committee Sunday, Cameron condemned IS, which has conquered vast swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, as the ""embodiment of evil"" and vowed that the UK would do everything possible to find Haines’s killers.

""We will hunt down those responsible and bring them to justice, no matter how long it takes,"" the grim-faced premier said in a televised statement from Downing Street.

He continued: ""Step by step we must drive back, dismantle and ultimately destroy ISIL (IS) and what is stands for. We will do so in a calm, deliberate way but with an iron determination.

""We will not do so on our own, but by working closely with our allies, not just the United States and in Europe, but with our allies in the region.""

US President Barack Obama said after the killing that the United States would stand with Britain in an expanded effort against the terror group.

“We will work with the United Kingdom and a broad coalition of nations from the region and around the world to bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice, and to degrade and destroy this threat to the people of our countries, the region and the world,” he said.

No comment on air strikes

Haines, 44, had been taken hostage in Syria in March 2013 while working for the French NGO ACTED, which was helping thousands of Syrians displaced by the fighting between Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s forces and rebel groups, including IS, seeking to oust him.

Cameron described 44-year-old Haines as a ""British hero"", saying that ""his selflessness, his decency, his burning desire to help others has today cost him his life"".

Those who killed him ""are not Muslims, they are monsters"", he said.

Cameron repeated his support for US air strikes against IS in Iraq, and for President Obama's strategy to build a broad coalition to fight the jihadists.

But despite growing calls at home for action against IS, Cameron made no commitment to Britain joining the air strikes.

London began sending arms this week to Kurdish fighters battling IS militants in northern Iraq, but it has faced accusations of confusion over its strategy.

During a visit to Berlin this week, Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Britain would not take part in strikes against IS in Syria, after parliament last year voted against taking military action in that country.

But just hours later, a spokesman for Cameron's Downing Street office insisted the prime minister was not ruling anything out.

In the footage of Haines’s murder, a hooded militant blames Cameron for joining forces with the United States and says the alliance will drag the British people into ""another bloody and unwinnable war"".

‘Barbaric crime must not remain unpunished’

In a statement, ACTED said it was “deeply appalled and horrified” by the murder.

“David was a new member of the ACTED team supporting the emergency humanitarian response for the displaced Syrian people in Atmeh camp near to the Turkish border,” it said.

“David was appreciated by the ACTED team and all those around him, notably for his generosity, commitment, and his professionalism.

“The horrible assassination of David, an aid worker, goes against all humanitarian principles and is a crime against humanity. This barbaric crime must not remain unpunished.”

Before joining ACTED, Haines had also worked for groups such as Handicap International, which helps the disabled during conflicts, and Nonviolent Peaceforce, which sends unarmed peacekeepers into conflict zones. He had previously been in Libya during its civil war and South Sudan.

His brother, Mike Haines, said he had also worked for the United Nations in the Balkans “helping people in real need”.

“His joy and anticipation for the work he went to do in Syria is for myself and family the most important element of this whole sad affair,” Mike Haines said. “He was and is loved by all his family and will be missed terribly.”

"589","The reveal of the Apple Watch was unusual for Cupertino, which has traditionally announced products that are ready to launch. We won't be seeing the smarwatch until next year, and Apple is still keeping a few of the details under wraps, including the specs and price.

But one source claims to know what the internals of the smartwatch will be. The word comes from analyst Timothy Arcuri of Cowen and Company, who quotes a source from Apple's supply chain.

Apparently, the component creators believe the wearable will pack in 512MB of RAM and offer 4GB of RAM as standard, which puts it on an equal footing with the top Android Wear devices out there right now, such as the Samsung Gear 2 and the LG G Watch R.

Arcuri also says that Apple might be offering an 8GB version of the watch as well, though it's unclear whether this information also comes direct from the source - or whether it's speculation on his part.

Juice it up

Finally, Arcuri also says he expects the Apple Watch to feature a wireless chip similar to the one found in the iPhone 5S, which actually included a GPS radio. However, that would contradict Apple, which stated that the Watch will need an iPhone in order to use GPS, so we'd say it's less likely.

Speaking of chips, Chipworks has provided a visual teardown of the Apple Watch internals, and it reckons it's spotted the Broadcom Wi-Fi chip that Cupertino has chosen for its debut wearable.

The important takeaway point is that, if Chipworks is right, the BCM4334 chip used will mean the watch should offer minimal power consumption in the connectivity department.

However, the word right now is that Apple's smartwatch battery will last a day in its current state, so the company might have to look elsewhere in the watch if it wants to insert a little more juicepower before launch.

Apple's watch is still in prototype right now but we don't expect too many of the specs to change before next year. If anything does, we really, really hope it's the battery life."

"593","A PGA Tour golfer said he has sources who tell him that Tiger Woods is currently serving a one-month suspension for PED use. 

Tiger Woods has had a tough career as of late, plagued with injuries and surgeries that have complicated his strong golf swing, and now that he’s taken “a leave of absence” until his golf game is “tournament ready,” he’s facing criticism.

This criticism blew up Monday morning when professional, but not well-known PGA Tour golfer Dan Olsen went on a radio interview with David “Mad Dog” DeMarco on 730 WVFN’s The Game in Lansing, MI and claimed that Tiger Woods is serving a suspension for using PEDs.

“I heard he’s on a month suspension,” Olsen said. “And it’s kind of a strong witness, a credible person that’s telling me this… It’s not testosterone, but it’s something else. I think when it is all said and done, he is going to surpass Lance Armstrong with…a…infamy.”

WOW. Dan Olsen, who are you?

Olsen’s dislike for Tiger Woods must be really strong if he’s going to go on radio and make wild claims that haven’t been evidenced by anything or anyone else.

As if this wild claim wasn’t enough, Olsen went on to basically say that Tiger is just one big cheater and dragged Rory McIlroy into it.

“Tiger, he’s got some problems now,” Olsen said. “One of the big problems, Nike’s been giving Tiger a ball that I would almost bet hasn’t been tested…Rory played it too. Remember when Rory signed the Nike deal and he played like an amateur for a year? He was going to fail out of the contract unless he got the high-spin ball too… So if you go to Tour events, Nike pays them, pays the Tour staff and the range staff, they pay them to get all those balls back. That’s why Tiger would never sign a golf ball and give it away… He played a ball that nobody else could play.”

Again, wow. Dan Olsen is going all in on Tiger Woods, staking his reputation (which obviously isn’t much because most people have never heard of him) to call out Tiger as a cheater.

It’s a tough claim to believe, and one you don’t want to believe, either. Tiger Woods is one of the best golfers to play the game and when he’s done he’ll be remembered as the best.

Tiger has played two PGA Tour events this year and he missed the cut in Phoenix in January and withdrew from the Farmers Insurance Open in early February after suffering back pain. Because of his back surgery last summer, I guess it wouldn’t be shocking that Tiger would take PEDs, but IF he even has, they certainly haven’t helped him at all. And Tiger is a veteran, he knows about drug testing and he’s gone through it his whole career.

The claims by Olsen, who has played in 35 PGA Tour events in his career with no top ten finishes, seem farfetched and forced, but you can’t discount them completely. We’ll see if this prompts Tiger Woods or the PGA of America to make a statement denying these facts or coming clean on something that may or may not be true."
"595","Multiple users of anonymous Web browser Tor have reported that Comcast has threatened to cut off their Internet service unless they stop using the legal software. 

According to a report on DeepDotWeb, Comcast customer representatives have branded Tor “illegal” and told customers that using it is against the company’s policies.

Tor is a type of Web browser that, in theory, makes all your Internet activity private. The software routes traffic through a series of other connected Internet users, making it difficult for governments and private companies to monitor your Internet usage. Up to 1.2 million people use the browser, which became especially popular after Edward Snowden leaked information showing that the NSA was eavesdropping on ordinary citizens. Prior to that, Tor had been popular among people transacting business on Silk Road, the online market for drugs and hit men.

The problem is that downloading or using Tor itself isn’t illegal. Plenty of people might have legitimate reasons to want to surf the Web in private, without letting others know what they were looking at. But Tor has been pretty popular with criminals.

Comcast has reportedly begun telling users that it is an “illegal service.” One Comcast representative, identified only as “Kelly,” warned a customer over his use of Tor software, DeepDotWeb reports:

“Users who try to use anonymity, or cover themselves up on the Internet, are usually doing things that aren’t so-to-speak legal. We have the right to terminate, fine, or suspend your account at any time due to you violating the rules. Do you have any other questions? Thank you for contacting Comcast, have a great day.”

Comcast customers, speaking to DeepDotWeb, claimed that Comcast repeatedly asked them which sites they were accessing using Tor.

In a statement to DeepDotWeb, Comcast defended its actions, seemingly asserting that it needs to be able to monitor Internet traffic in case it receives a court order:

“We respect customer privacy and security and would only investigate the specifics of a customer’s account with a valid court order. And if we’re asked by a court to provide customer information, then we ask for a reasonable amount of time to notify the customer so they can decide if they would like to hire a lawyer and if they do, then we turn the case over to them and they proceed with the judge directly and we step away.”"

"599","SYDNEY - A girlfriend of Michael Phelps has revealed that she was born and brought up a man, reports said on Thursday.

Taylor Lianne Chandler, who dated the 29-year-old US swimmer for months, wrote a long post on her Facebook page on Nov 14 in which she revealed that she was ""born intersex and named David Roy Fitch"" at birth.

""I was born with male genitalia with no testicles, but I also have a uterus and no ovaries,"" the 41-year-old told Radar Online in an interview.

She also said that she has always felt like a woman, and underwent surgery in her teens to become one.

In her post, she said she has dated many celebrities, none of whom knew about her past.

Chandler met Phelps on dating app Tinder, and was with the Olympian when he was arrested for drink driving on Sep 30.

He has been suspended from competition and checked himself into a rehabilitation facility in October.

Chandler said she did not tell Phelps about her complicated past, but has emailed him about it after his arrest.

""I never lied to him,"" Chandler said. ""We were together for such a short period of time, I never had a chance to tell him about my life.""

She also told Radar Online that the intimacy she felt with Phelps was ""amazing"" and it was the first time ""someone has made me feel like a real woman"".

She said it's not clear if they will still be together after his rehabilitation.

""Michael is a brand, and dating someone like me may not be the best thing,"" she told Radar Online. ""I just hope he follows his heart and not what his people tell him.""

After tabloid magazine the National Enquirer featured Chandler on its cover with the headline ""Michael Phelps new girlfriend was born a man"", she has lashed out on social media, objecting to being called ""a man"".

"600","Abuja (AFP) - Nigeria on Friday claimed to have reached a deal with Boko Haram militants on a ceasefire and the release of more than 200 kidnapped schoolgirls but doubts immediately surrounded the purported breakthrough.

Chief of Defence Staff Air Marshal Alex Badeh told senior military officials from Nigeria and Cameroon meeting in Abuja that a ""ceasefire agreement"" had been concluded between the government and the insurgents.

""I have accordingly directed the service chiefs to ensure immediate compliance with this development,"" he added.

Badeh's announcement came after a senior aide to President Goodluck Jonathan, Hassan Tukur, told AFP that an agreement to end hostilities had been reached following talks, as well as for the release of 219 girls held captive since April.

But a precedent of previous claims from the government and military about an end to the deadly five-year conflict and the fate of the missing teenagers left many observers urging caution.

Jonathan is also expected to declare his bid for re-election in the coming weeks, with positive news about the hostages and the violence likely to give him a political boost.

Multiple analysts cast doubt over the credibility of a man called Danladi Ahmadu, whom Tukur claimed represented Boko Haram at the two meetings in neighbouring Chad.

""I have never heard of such a man (Ahmadu) and if Boko Haram wanted to declare a ceasefire it would come from the group's leader Abubakar Shekau,"" said Shehu Sani, a Boko Haram expert who has negotiated with the group before on behalf of the government.

Ralph Bello-Fadile an advisor to Nigeria's National Security Advisor (NSA), told a conference on Monday that the NSA has been inundated with fraudsters claiming to represent Shekau.

""Government wants to negotiate,"" he told a Chatham House event in Abuja, ""but so far nobody has come forward who speaks for Shekau.""

- Chad talks -

Tukur said he represented the government at two meetings with the Islamists in Chad, which were mediated by the country's President Idriss Deby.

""Boko Haram issued the ceasefire as a result of the discussions we have been having with them,"" said Tukur, adding that Ahmadu made the announcement on Thursday evening.

""They have agreed to release the Chibok girls,"" he continued, referring to the girls seized in northeast Nigeria on April 14, causing global outrage.

Ndjamena refused to comment but security sources in the country said Chad, which Jonathan visited for talks with Deby early last month, had been involved in the discussions.

The source also said a ceasefire agreement was reached as well as the release of 27 hostages, 10 of them Chinese nationals, who were kidnapped in northern Cameroon earlier this year.

The release of the hostages last weekend was ""a first strong signal"" from Boko Haram to prove their good faith, the source added but did not mention the schoolgirls.

- Discrepancies -

Ahmadu gave an interview broadcast on Friday on the Hausa language service of Voice of America radio in which he claimed to be the group's ""chief security officer"" and in charge of publicity.

He made no mention of an end to hostilities and was vague on details of the apparent talks, even claiming not to have met Shekau.

He also referred to the jihadi group as Boko Haram, a name that means 'Western education is forbidden' which was imposed on the Islamist radicals by outsiders. The insurgents themselves never use the term.

The group's known leaders have exclusively used the name Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, which means ""People Committed to the Propagation of the Prophet's Teachings and Jihad"".

He made no reference to the Chibok girls and did not list the creation of an Islamic state in Nigeria's mainly Muslim north -- the core, unwavering Boko Haram demand since the uprising began.

Shekau has in a series of video messages since 2012 ruled out talks with the government and said northern Nigeria will never know peace until sharia (Islamic law) is strictly enforced.

Envoys from Nigeria's presidency have made similar ceasefire claims in the past, notably Jonathan's Minister for Special Duties Taminu Turaki, who led a so-called amnesty commission in 2013 that was tasked with brokering peace.

Turaki on several occasions maintained that he was negotiating with legitimate Boko Haram commanders, including Shekau's immediate deputies, and that a ceasefire was at hand.

But nothing materialised from Turaki's protracted negotiations. Shekau said that he never sent delegates to any talks and attacks continued at a relentless pace."
"601","An explosion and a crater reported near the capital of Nicaragua raised suspicions on Monday that a meteorite had split off from an asteroid that passed by Earth this weekend and struck our planet. But NASA scientists have now cast doubt on whether the blast outside Managua was even a meteorite at all.

The blast left a hole 40 feet (12 meters) wide and 19 feet (5 meters) deep outside the international airport serving Nicaragua's capital. Some Nicaraguan astronomers quoted in early news reports attributed the blast to a chip off a weekend asteroid flyby.

But outside meteorite experts later downplayed links to the small asteroid, dubbed 2014 RC, which passed harmlessly by Earth over the weekend. About the size of a house, 2014 RC passed within 22,000 miles (36,000 kilometers) of our planet on Sunday.

""Information is limited, but the miss distance of 2014 RC actually precludes any related meteorite impact"" at the Managua crater, says MIT asteroid expert Richard Binzel, by email.

Managua Meteorite?

Managua residents reported the blast just after midnight. In some news reports, geophysicist Wilfried Strauch of Nicaragua's Institute of Earth Studies attributed the crater to a meteorite impact.

However, NASA asteroid expert Don Yeomans, author of Near-Earth Objects: Finding Them Before They Find Us, says that outside experts suspect the crater wasn't caused by an impact.

""This event was separated by 13 hours from the close Earth approach of 2014 RC, so the explosion and the asteroid are unrelated,"" says Yeomans, because the Earth moves about 870,000 miles (1.4 million kilometers) in 13 hours. ""There was no obvious optical fireball or debris trail seen prior to the explosion, so it seems unlikely that the explosion in Nicaragua was related to a meteorite impact.""

Russian Roulette

Meteorite impacts have occurred at the same time unconnected asteroid flybys in the past, most notably in the February 15, 2013, Chelyabinsk impact, which damaged buildings across central Russia. (See ""Chelyabinsk Meteor: The Animated Movie."")

That meteorite impact sprang from an object roughly the size of 2014 RC exploding in the atmosphere above Russia, with about 500 kilotons of energy, bright enough to sunburn some watchers. A larger asteroid had passed harmlessly over the Southern Hemisphere on the same date.

Update: In a late Monday report on RC 2014, astronomers at NASA's Near-Earth Object Program based at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, revised size estimates for the asteroid. Radar observations indicate that the asteroid is about 40 feet (12 meters) across and rotates rapidly, several times a minute. That makes it roughly half the size of the 2013 Russian meteorite.

The NASA update also called the meteorite report from Managua ""unrelated"" to RC 2014, citing the 13-hour difference in the asteroid flyby and the crater explosion. ""As yet, no eyewitness accounts or imagery have come to light of the fireball flash or debris trail that is typically associated with a meteor of the size required to produce such a crater,"" noted the statement."
"603","A catholic priest from Masschussetts, who was reported dead for close to an hour before medics were able to revive him, has made a shocking revelation upon his return to life.

The 71-years old priest, identified as, Father John Micheal O’neal, claims he went to heaven and met God, whom he describes as a warm and comforting motherly figure.

‘Her presence was both overwhelming and comforting, she had a soft and soothing voice and her presence was as reassuring as a mother’s embrace.

‘The fact that God is a Holy Mother instead of a Holy Father doesn’t disturb me, she is everything I hoped she would be and even more!’

Despite the shocking revelation, which is being received with a bit of confusion in the Catholic world, Father O’neal says he still wishes to continue dedicating his life to God and spread the word of the ‘Holy Mother’.

‘I wish to continue preaching. I would like to share my new knowledge of the Mother, the Son and the Holy Ghost with all Catholics and even all Christians. God is great and almighty despite being a woman,’ he said.

With his new outlook, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston is yet to confirm if Father O’neal will be permitted to resume preaching in his former parish in South Boston or not.

Father John Micheal O’neal, who was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital on Thursday, January 29, 2015, was revived through the aid of a high-tech machine called LUCAS 2, which kept the blood flowing to his brain as doctors managed to unblock vital arteries and return his heart to a normal rhythm, after a major heart attack.

The Telegraph reported Tuesday that Woods' former 62-acre island in Lake Malaren, Sweden, has been put on the market. 

The listing agent for Vladi Private Islands says the island, about an hour from Stockholm, features one golf hole in addition to a “mini mansion,” secluded villa, hunting lodge, private barber and landing strip for propeller planes. How convenient! 

“This island was owned by Tiger Woods,” the listing agent said, “but after his divorce he doesn’t need an island in Sweden anymore. This is a unique, exclusive private island with total privacy. … 

“The protected location, combined with the quay’s generous dimensions, make it an ideal place for private parties and outdoor dining.”

"607","If we've learned anything in 2014, it's that teenagers are to be both feared and revered. In a profile published over at New York magazine, one 17-year-old New Yorker confirms that he made $72 million trading stocks during his lunch break at his high school. Someone please send help!!!!

Mohammed Islam is the son of Bengali immigrants who live in Queens. He attends Stuyvesant High School in downtown Manhattan. And now he is richer than all of us by an unfathomable margin. The profile of Islam doesn't seem willing to explain where he got the money to begin investing (there is a mention of earning tutoring money when he was nine) but it does show that teens are just as ridiculous and spunky whether they have a few bucks allowance or $72 million in investments:

Mo, a cherubic senior with a goatee and slight faux-hawk, smiled shyly. ""He's quiet today,"" said Patrick Trablusi, who was seated with Mo and Damir at a table littered with empty glasses. ""Humble."" And tired: ""This is our third meeting of the day,"" Damir said, signaling to the waitress for another round. ""We saw a real-estate agent, a lawyer, you …""

""Next we're going to see a hedge-fund guy,"" Patrick said. The friends locked eyes and started to giggle.

""He basically wants to give us $150 million,"" Mo explained, a blush like a sunset creeping over his cheeks.

The waitress arrived with a tray of green drinks. ""Freshly squeezed apple juice,"" Damir said, passing them around. ""It's very good. Do you like caviar?""

New York magazine confirmed that Islam's net worth is in the high eight figures. The teen made his money trading in oil and gold but he won't stop there. Though his parents won't let him move into his rented Manhattan apartment and he can't drive his newly purchased BMW (no driver's license just yet), Islam and his team of three teen Wall Street JV investors plan on starting a hedge fund together in a few months.

As they nobly point out, teens get the money:

""Money never sleeps!"" Damir added. ""That's from the Wall Street movie.""

""It all comes down to this,"" Mo continued. ""What makes the world go round? Money. If money is not flowing, if businesses don't keep going, there's no innovation, no products, no investments, no growth, no jobs.""

What were you doing as a teenager hey don't answer that.

"610","On Friday, Esquire published an article titled “ESPN Has A Problem With Women” that suggests the network was planning to host a male-only panel discussion on domestic violence during this week’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast.

The article begins:

On Monday night, a panel on a two-hour pregame show for Monday Night Football will, among other things, address domestic abuse. This panel will discuss, once again, the appropriate penalty for hitting a woman.

The panel for that discussion will include the following people: Chris Berman, Cris Carter, Mike Ditka, Adam Schefter, Tom Jackson, Keyshawn Johnson, Jon Gruden, Mike Tirico, Stuart Scott, Steve Young and Ray Lewis.

Up to 11 men, all between the ages of 39 and 74 will sit at the table for a domestic violence discussion on ESPN. Zero women. Victims of domestic violence in America are most likely to be women aged 20-24.

When the show has updates from the field—brief reports about injuries and the upcoming game—they’ll cut to female sideline reporters, Lisa Salters and, on some weeks, Suzy Kolber.

These people are not allowed at the table.

The assertion that ESPN would host such a panel discussion and not invite any women to participate sparked outrage.

THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/lasYPHtbXl

Utterly speechless. RT @Lahlahlindsey THIS IS HORRIFYING http://t.co/ycDWFvwtfI …

Chris Berman and Mike Ditka, who are not good at talking about *football,* talking about domestic violence? This has a chance to be A+ TV.

Several other blogs wrote posts questioning why ESPN would only let men participate in this domestic violence discussion. (H/t Deadspin)

ESPN Doesn’t Get It: They Ignore Women’s Voices In Public Dialog About Domestic Violence

ESPN’s Domestic Violence Panel Is Missing Something Important

11 Men and 0 Women on Tonight’s ESPN Domestic Violence Panel

Esquire writer Ben Collins who posted the original article took to Twitter to attempt to clarify what he wrote.

Hi, everybody now reading my ESPN story @Lahlahlindsey's tweet! Note: There's no special panel on tomorrow's Countdown for domestic violence

...Those are the people on the show every week. They haven't changed it in the last few weeks, either. Don't know if that's better or worse.

But there was a top sentence left off that tweet that's going around, and I wanted to clarify. ESPN is mad enough at me as it is. Thank you.

On Monday, ESPN’s John Wildhack, executive vice president of programming and production released a statement refuting Esquire’s original report that the network scheduled any sort of domestic violence panel discussion.

Contrary to published reports in Esquire, there was no panel on domestic violence ever planned for tonight’s Monday Night Countdown. We will present our normal Monday Night Football pre-game show, with Suzy Kolber hosting. ESPN is proud of the work it has done covering the issue of domestic violence, and is committed to continued coverage. Much of that work has been informed by several talented female colleagues from our television and espnW platforms, including Hannah Storm, Jemele Hill, Jane McManus, Kate Fagan, Sarah Spain and more.

ESPN published a blog post highlighting reporting on domestic abuse by its female staffers since the Ray Rice scandal broke last month.

ESPN also posted a list of highlights for tonight’s “Monday Night Football” broadcast, which includes no discussion about domestic violence.

ESPN reporter Jane McManus took to Twitter to debunk Esquire’s domestic violence panel story.

ESPN is about to release a statement. I'll go through a few points here. There was never a domestic violence panel planned for MNF tonight.

Since the Rice story broke, ESPN has featured several women prominently, including myself, @katefagan3, @SarahSpain @jemelehill etc.

Tonight's regular MNF panel will be hosted by Suzy Kolber. It was never meant to be a single-issue discussion of domestic violence.

Esquire did not immediately return a request for comment."
"611","OTTAWA – The man who is reported to have shot an assailant on Parliament Hill today is a former police officer with a background in providing security services for dignitaries, including members of the Royal Family.

Kevin Vickers became the sergeant-at-arms in the House of Commons eight years ago after a varied career in security.

He spent 29 years with the RCMP and rose to the rank of chief superintendent, often serving as the face of the national police force in New Brunswick.

The 58-year-old was appointed director of security operations for the House of Commons in June 2005.

He had previously worked as aide-de-camp for New Brunswick’s lieutenant-governor.

The sergeant-at-arms is responsible for safeguarding the authority of the House of Commons, as well as the safety and security of the Parliament buildings.

As an RCMP officer, Vickers has been responsible for security services provided for the Queen and Prince Andrew.

On Twitter, MPs credited Vickers with saving their lives.

“MPs and Hill staff owe their safety, even lives, to Sergeant at Arms Kevin Vickers who shot attacker just outside the MPs’ caucus rooms,” tweeted New Democrat Craig Scott.

Veterans Affairs Minister Julian Fantino tweeted: “I am safe & profoundly grateful to Sgt at Arms Kevin Vickers & our security forces for selfless act of keeping us safe.”"

A blundering Romeo who wanted to propose to his girlfriend with a big bang burnt down his college when fireworks he took to mark the event set fire to dry grass.

Dim Xiong Chien, 22, had taken three large boxes of fireworks onto campus where he planned to set them off as he got down on one knee and popped the question to girlfriend Cong Yen, 22.

But when she forgot to turn up he set them off anyway hoping she would see them and go and see what was happening.

When Chien's girlfriend did not turn up he lit the fireworks anyway, hoping she would see them and come to see what was happening

Pal Shin Tan, 21, said: ""He had prepared this big event in secret and had told her to meet him by the sports ground for a romantic walk.

""She had no idea he was planning to propose though, and clearly forgot all about the walk.""

As firemen rushed to the scene to put out the three-metre high flames on the grass, gutted Chien went looking for forgetful Yen.

He said: ""I was feeling a bit surprised that she hadn’t shown up, and was completely unaware that the fireworks had set the grass on fire.

""When I found her I said she had to come with me as there was something important I wanted to tell her and show her.

""But as we approached the sports hall we saw all these flames and firemen and I decided to postpone the proposal to another date.""

Bewildered Yen told local TV: ""I found out later that he wanted to ask me to marry him.

""Of course, I love him, but my parents have told me to steer clear, saying he can’t even ask me to marry him without causing a massive hoo-ha.""

"614","Batman as Steve Jobs? Sure. How about that guy from Superbad as Woz, too?
Seth Rogen has reportedly signed on to star as Steve Wozniak in the upcoming Steve Jobs film from Sony. You know, the as-yet-untitled biopic written by Aaron Sorkin, creator of ""The Newsroom"" and ""The West Wing.""
The comic actor would join Christian Bale, who is tipped to play Jobs, according to Variety.
Sony's flick would be the fourth such feature film that's either in the works or has already been made about Jobs, sharing the marquee with 2013's ""Jobs"" (the one with Ashton Kutcher), ""iSteve"" from the same year (the one made by Funny or Die), and 1999's ""Pirates of Silicon Valley"" (the one where the iPhone hadn't been invented yet). One might argue that the world is a bit Jobs'd out, but we suppose it depends on the strength of Sorkin's script and Danny Boyle's directing.
On the plus side, the film is based on Walter Isaacson's biography of the late Apple CEO—titled simply, ""Steve Jobs""—which was Amazon's best-selling book for 2011.
If you ask Sorkin, though, the movie isn't entirely biographical per se.
""It's not a biopic; it's not the story of Steve Jobs—it's something much different than that. He's a fascinating guy—part hero, part antihero,"" Sorkin said earlier this year, as reported by Mashable.
""I don't want to make any news or make anyone feel like I approached the movie in a different way. I'm going to make the movie speak for itself. But he's a fascinating guy surrounded by fascinating people, and he had very interesting relationships with the people in his life,"" Sorkin said in a separate interview.
Rogen isn't officially on board just yet, per The Hollywood Reporter, and it's unknown whether an official offer has been made or even if any kind of negotiations have taken place. Bale is supposed to be in the midst of negotiations to appear as Jobs.
Leonardo DiCaprio was first tapped for the role of Jobs, but dropped out earlier this month to take a role in ""The Revenant."" After that, DiCaprio plans to take a long break from acting, according to The Hollywood Reporter."

"616","Breaking news on Sunday morning reports that senior western intelligence officials confirm that the London rapper is the major suspect in the beheading of James Foley. The London rapper, Abdel Majed Abdel Bary, is the 23-year-old man believed to have beheaded Foley on the video that was seen worldwide last week, according to Fox News on Aug. 24.

Bary, who was big into the London rap scene was heard on the BBC radio with his music, but he left London last year to go to Syria and fight with the ISIS. Bary is identified as one of the group that consists of at least three British-born ISIS fighter, dubbed “The Beatles.”

The Israel Times reports today that Bary’s songs were featured on BBC radio in the past, as he was at one time a popular rapper going by the name Jinn Matic. Those recordings of his songs that once played on the radio are a treasure trove of data used by the investigators today.

Britain used high tech voice recognition to identify “Jihadi John,” the man seen in the video with Foley, reports the Telegraph. Bary’s recording music has been of vital importance when using the high-tech equipment to identify the voice on the video. His songs like Dreamer, Flying High and Overdose were hits on the popular BBC radio, but they are important pieces of evidence today, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.

While news that Bary was suspected to be the man seen on the video beheading Foley hit early this weekend. On Sunday morning it is confirmed that he is the main suspect and not just one of many.

Dressed all in black with a mask covering his face, the executioner beheaded James Foley, an American journalist, on a video that was later posted on YouTube by ISIS. Barry was seen early this month on YouTube holding the severed head of one of his victims, so there’s no question about him being very capable of what many see as pure evil. The beheading of James Foley is not the end of the violence from this group warn officials."

The World Health Organization and the Ministry of Health in Iraq made that clear in a statement late Monday, saying there are no suspected infections from the deadly virus in the country. That came after rumors spread online and through several media outlets on Dec. 31. Most of them cited anonymous medical sources in the city of Mosul, which has been under the control of Islamic State militants since June.

The virus spreading through Iraq would have raised concerns for both the local population and American troops who recently began training the Iraqi military. According to the discredited reports, the virus was said to have been brought to Iraq by militants and other migrants coming to the country from Africa.

Health officials said that simply isn’t true. The Ministry of Health and World Health Organization investigated the reports through surveillance networks and contacts with medical sources in Mosul, and found that there were no cases of the virus.

“The Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization further confirmed that the laboratory facilities in Mosul do not have the necessary capabilities to diagnose and confirm the Ebola Virus,” according to the joint statement–a question that was raised by skeptics when the rumors spread last week.

Here’s a sampling of tweets on the rumors before the announcement:

"621","A Sept. 8 U.S. Department of Defense news article talking about the success of airstrikes in Iraq mentions a question from the media — and answer — about the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.

From the article:

In response to a question about the reported deaths of ISIL leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi and some of his advisors in an air strike, (Pentagon spokesman Army Col. Steve) Warren  said the U.S. has not conducted any targeted airstrikes against specific ISIL personnel.

“I hope he’s dead. We certainly hope he’s dead, but we haven’t conducted any strikes against him,” he said.

“With every terrorist that we kill from the air, that is one less terrorist on the ground,” the colonel added.

Warren also said this in talking about the airstrikes against ISIS:

Certainly, ISIL forces realize that when American airpower is deployed, their chance of survival goes to nil.”

"622","Breaking!  J.J. Abrams has reportedly approached Disney about moving up the Star Wars: The Force Awakens release date. This comes from the mouth of Abrams himself, addressing a group of attendees at a recent industry event, the 2015 Visual Effects Society Awards… this is awards season after-all. Apparently, his desire for secrecy does not apply in this case, as he openly expressed his frustration about the Episode VII leaks.

Adamant about the project’s secrecy, Disney is reportedly taking Abrams’ request very seriously and is looking at a possible summer release. This would put Star Wars up against other giant franchise releases, namely Jurassic World and Avengers 2: Age Of Ultron. Does this make sense for Star Wars' highly anticipated return to the silver-screen?

Earlier this week, Disney issued a subpoena over Star Wars: The Force Awakens leaked photos. This indicates that the company is taking measures to prevent further leaks, making Abrams’ desire to move up the current December 18th, 2015 opening date a very real scenario.



Does this mean we are in the final stages of post-production? How far along is the marketing and promotional art? When will we see the new toys and merchandise? As usual, it’s too soon to celebrate and we now have more questions than before we started.

"625","Scottish people have some of the strongest stomachs in the world – but even they may struggle with a restaurant from cheese-obsessed North Korean lardball Kim Jong-Un.

The waddling dictator has already opened branches of the Pyongyang restaurant in China and Holland – with some serving delicacies such as dog-meat soup and a bottled aphrodisiac allegedly made from bears.

Next to that lot, deep fried Mars bars and a national dish made from sheep’s bowels sounds positively delicious.

Kim is alleged to be eyeing up Scotland because of his love of whisky – which is so popular in his communist dictatorship it’s sometimes used instead of money.

The podgy autocrat also admires Alex Salmond’s attempt to break free of English control last year.

While that is something that Scots might be able to get on board with, it’s debatable whether they’ll share Kim’s taste in food, with Western Pyongyang outlets serving ‘delicacies’ such as pine nut gruel.

MORE: Google thinks photoshopped picture of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in drag is his younger sister

The key question may be whether Kim offers Irn Bru alongside the ginseng wine offered in other Pyongyang outlets.

Michael Madden, editor of the North Korea Leadership Watch, said Jong-un is desperate to build diplomatic ties with European countries with left-wing leanings.

‘The Scottish independence referendum catapulted Scotland into the North Korean elite’s thoughts.

‘Despite voting No’ they’d consider left-leaning Scotland to be more suitable to deal with than England. Plus, North Koreans love whisky. Tourists in North Korea are told to tip people in Scotch instead of the currency.’

One of the restaurants has already opened in Holland.

They are run in partnership with Office 39, a secretive branch of the North Korean government, which uses them as a legal way of raising overseas cash.

Mr Madden, a frequent visitor to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, added: “They are one of the few ways to experience North Korean culture without having to go there.

‘They are done like a franchise with the state renting the brand out to other Koreans to run.

‘But they tailor the menus to suit. Customers in Western Europe won’t get a plateful of dog!’"
"626","The suitcase held a number of the dog's belongings, including a pillow, toy, food bowl and food

A shar-pei cross has been found abandoned at a railway station along with a suitcase with his belongings.

The dog, named Kai, was tied to a railing outside Ayr station in Scotland.

The Scottish SPCA (Scotland’s Animal Welfare Charity) is appealing for information.

A statement from the SPCA said: ""Regardless of the act Kai was left with his belongings, this was a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible.""

The suitcase held a number of the dog's belongings, including a pillow, toy, food bowl and food.

Inspector Stewart Taylor said: ""The dog is microchipped and we were able to find out his name is Kai.

""We contacted the owner registered to the microchip, who stated they had sold Kai on Gumtree in 2013. Unfortunately they could not tell us the address of the person who bought him.""

Abandoning an animal is an offence under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or life.

Inspector Taylor added: ""This case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about."""

Two Australian men claim to have the oldest burger in the world - at a staggering 20 years old.

In 1995 Adelaide residents Casey Dean, 14, and his mate Eduard Nitz, 13, stopped off at their local McDonald’s to pick up some burgers.

Among them was a Quarter Pounder with cheese they’d bought for another kid. That kid never turned up, but they didn’t eat his burger. Ever.

Now the boys have become men and the burger has turned 20.

“We’re pretty sure it’s the oldest burger in the world,” Mr Dean said.

“It started off as a joke, you know we told our friend we’d hold his burger for him but he never turned up and before we knew it six months had passed.

""The months became years and now, 20 years later, it looks the same as it did the day we bought it, perfectly preserved in its original wrapping.”

"630","BEIRUT—Former Iraqi military officers who have joined Islamic State are training pilots to fly three captured Syrian military jets, a monitoring group said Friday.

The officers, who served in the Iraqi military during the 24-year rule of Saddam Hussein, are conducting the training at the captured al-Jarrah military airport east of Aleppo in northern Syria, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.

The Observatory, citing unnamed sources, said the aircraft were believed to be MiG-21s and MiG-23s that were seized at Syrian air bases in the provinces of Aleppo and Raqqa after the bases were captured by Islamic State forces. The organization didn’t report what weaponry, if any, the aircraft were carrying.

The claims, which the Observatory said were based on eyewitness reports to monitors, couldn’t be independently confirmed.

The Observatory is a U.K.-based group that has a network of antigovernment activists in Syria who supply accounts on fighting in the country, now in the fourth year of a civil war."
"632","Extremist group the Islamic State claims to have executed American journalist James Foley, who was abducted in Syria in 2012. The FBI is evaluating a video that was posted online Tuesday, purporting to show Foley's beheading.

That video was uploaded to YouTube on Tuesday afternoon and later removed. The images show a man resembling Foley kneeling next to a masked militant, reciting comments against the U.S. before being killed.

U.S. officials tell the Associated Press that Islamic State had recently threatened to kill Foley to avenge U.S. airstrikes that have helped Iraqi forces regain key sites, including the Mosul dam.

The Islamic State also says it's holding another American journalist, Steven Joel Sotloff, who went missing in Syria last year, and that Sotloff could be the next victim.

National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden says U.S. officials are studying the video to determine whether it's genuine:

Foley has been missing since November of 2012, when he was kidnapped while reporting in Syria for the news organization GlobalPost. A Facebook page was later created to call for his return; last night, it posted this statement from Foley's mother, Diane:

GlobalPost notes that, ""The Foley family has not received confirmation of Jim's death from the U.S. government, and acknowledged that there is still a small chance the video of his apparent killing will prove to have been fake.""

The company's CEO and co-founder, Philip Balboni, says GlobalPost had been working to learn who kidnapped Foley, and where he was being held captive.

""Although GlobalPost's investigation at one point led us to believe that James was being held by the Syrian government, we later were given strong reason to believe he was being held by Islamic militants in Syria,"" Balboni said. ""We withheld this information at the request of the family and on the advice of authorities cooperating in the effort to protect Jim. GlobalPost, working with a private security company, has amassed an enormous amount of information that has not been made public.""

Foley was on a freelance assignment for GlobalPost when he was abducted in northern Syria on Nov. 22, 2012. He had been making his way to the Turkish border when he was stopped by a group of armed men, the organization says.

Back in 2011, Foley was one of three journalists who were held captive for more than a month after being attacked by Gaddafi fighters near Benghazi. A fourth journalist didn't survive the attack.

Their ordeal led Foley and one of his colleagues, American Claire Gillis, to visit NPR's Talk of the Nation back in 2011. Discussing the uncertain weeks of their captivity, Foley said they ""turned to a lot of prayer"" and exercise. In the end, he was the last of the journalists to be released, after spending a week as the sole Westerner in the prison.

""I started to have some dark thoughts,"" he said. ""I started to think, you know, maybe they're keeping the American guy as the ace in the hole... I thought maybe I was going to be a bargaining chip."""

Sorry to rain on the rumor mill's parade, but RoboCop-style robots are not patrolling Microsoft's Silicon Valley campus.

The rumor took shape after California-based Knightscope showed off its K5 security robot at an event hosted at Microsoft, according to Knightscope co-founder and Vice President Stacy Stephens.

""So people started snapping photos,"" and all the sudden a number of news outlets were reporting the robots had been deployed at Microsoft's offices in Mountain View, Calif., Stephens said.

The 5-feet, 300-pound K5 looks like R2-D2 from Star Wars. They roam around with a slew of sensors, looking for trouble, sounding alarms and alerting live security guards.

""Obviously we're right across the street so we would love them to be [a customer],"" Stephens said. ""But we have not deployed there.""

Stephens said he got a phone call from Microsoft this morning after the news broke.

"636","Eleven Iraqi police officers were taken to hospital after an ISIS chemical weapons attack, with the Defense Ministry and doctors recently confirming the gas as chlorine. This marks the first officially documented militant attack with the chemical.

The Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) militants’ chlorine gas attack occurred on September 15, in the town of Duluiyah, located north of the capital, according to a Washington Post report.

The blast followed an exchange of fire between the militants and the members of the Sunni Jabbour tribe, who were guarding the town’s borders.

“It was a strange explosion. We saw yellow smoke in the sky,” said Lt. Khairalla al-Jabbouri, one of the survivors.

The victims talked of the fog that hung close to the ground – a possible indication that it was chlorine, which is heavier than air.

The physicians who treated them also confirmed that their diagnosis was poisoning by chlorine gas.

“They were panicked; we were panicked,” said Kasim Hatim, director of the hospital in the nearby city of Balad, where the officers were taken. “We initially thought it might be a more serious gas, a nerve gas or an organophosphate.”

Image from Google MapsImage from Google Maps

A recent statement from the Iraqi Defense Ministry said that the IS had used the gas in a “primitive and ineffective way” – in roadside bomb attacks and near several water treatment plants where it had gained access to chlorine. Without indicating the locations of the attacks, the statement said that the militants aimed at impairing “the morale of the Iraqi people in general and our armed forces in particular.”

American defense officials were not aware of the September 15 chlorine attack and referred to the Iraqi government for further information.

Alistair Baskey, spokesman for the National Security Council, told the New York Times on Thursday, “The use of chlorine as a chemical weapon is an abhorrent act. These recent allegations underscore the importance of our work to eliminate chemical weapons in this volatile region.”

There have lately been several reports of IS militants using chlorine gas on the battlefield, however, none had been officially confirmed. They appeared after the jihadists seized a large former Iraqi chemical weapons production plant this summer, whose 2,500 degraded rockets the Iraqi officials claimed unlikely to be fit for use.

Earlier this week, reports were circulating that there was a chemical attack in the besieged Syrian town of Kobani on Tuesday. But the chemical agent the IS militants used couldn’t be identified, as doctors lacked necessary equipment to diagnose the cause of complaints made by Kurdish victims and activists.

As a choking agent, chlorine was widely used during World War I. Nowadays it is sold legally as a key component in industry, but its use as a chemical weapon violates the Chemical Weapons Convention."
"638","Claim: The town of Purdon, Texas was quarantined after a family of five there tested positive for the Ebola virus.

FALSE

Example: [Collected via email, October 2014]

News report of family of 5 in Purdon, Texas tested positive for Ebola. Town is quarantined.

Origins: On 14 October 2014, the National Report published an article claiming that the town of Purdon, Texas, had been quarantined after a local family of five tested positive for Ebola. Purdon is located 70 miles from Dallas, the city in which Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan died of the disease. Shortly after Duncan's death, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) disclosed that a nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital had contracted the hemorrhagic virus while caring for Duncan.

The National Report article referenced both the death of Duncan and the illness of nurse Nina Pham as context for the claim about a quarantine in Purdon:

"639","The World Health Organization is looking into reports that ISIS fighters in Iraq have been showing up at hospitals with Ebola symptoms.

According to the pro-government Iraqi newspaper al Sabaah, an unknown number of ISIS militants have shown up at a hospital in the militant-controlled city of Mosul, about 250 miles north of Baghdad. The paper reported that foreign terrorists brought the disease into Mosul from “several countries” in Africa. (RELATED: ISIS Massacred Every Man And Boy Over 15 In Muslim Town)

It’s not yet clear whether the ISIS extremists actually have Ebola or another disease. Ebola symptoms include fever, vomiting, diarrhea and unexplained bleeding and bruising — problems which could also be attributed to malaria or yellow fever. And doctors in Mosul might be unable to even test for Ebola.

WHO spokeswoman Christy Feig said the organization is reaching out to officials in the ISIS-held area to offer help if the disease does turn out to be Ebola. However, United Nations workers are not allowed to work in ISIS-controlled areas in either Iraq or Syria, so a UN operation to help either ISIS militants or any civilians in the areas who contract Ebola is unlikely.

Feig told Mashable that there’s been no official notification from the Iraqi government that the terrorists’ disease is, in fact, Ebola.

ISIS is against western science and medicine as a rule, but apparently several militants have taken to hospitals with Ebola-like symptoms anyway. Since taking control of Mosul in June 2014, ISIS has taken to executing doctors that refuse to treat them.

Kurdish news website Rudaw reported in Nov. 2014 that ISIS executed six doctors in Mosul for refusing to treat wounded fighters, in addition to kidnapping six merchants for failing to pay a monthly tax to ISIS. The group reportedly executed two more doctors just last week.

The U.S. has been hitting ISIS with air strikes since mid-November and the Pentagon confirmed in December that the strikes have killed around 1,000 fighters, including three senior ISIS officials.

An Ebola outbreak, however unlikely, probably wouldn’t help matters much.

The monarch may personally take part in bombing raids on extremist strongholds on Thursday, according to reports in Arabic-language newspapers.

It comes after the former general told members of Congress that he was ready to exact a blistering revenge against the ISIS terror army for the brutal execution of military pilot Moaz al-Kassasbeh - and he quoted a Clint Eastwood movie character to make his point.

Jordan's King Abdullah (pictured), a trained pilot, could lead revenge airstrikes on Islamic State himself, it has been revealed

Uncompromising language; King Abdullah of Jordan, (center), is hurried into a meeting with leaders of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the Capitol in Washington after shocking footage of a Jordanian pilot being burned alive was released online Tuesday

According to the dailycaller, reports have emerged suggesting he could take part in airstrikes on ISIS targets today.

California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter told the Washington Examiner that the king quoted the scene where Eastwood's character announces his plan for retribution.

'Any man I see out there, I'm gonna kill him,' Eastwood's William Munny says in 'Unforgiven.'

'Any son of a bitch takes a shot at me, I'm not only going to kill him, I'm going to kill his wife and all his friends and burn his damn house down.'

'He said there is going to be retribution like ISIS hasn't seen,' Hunter said. 'He's angry. 'They're starting more sorties tomorrow than they've ever had. They're starting tomorrow. And he said, ""The only problem we're going to have is running out of fuel and bullets"".'

'He's ready to get it on. He really is. It reminded me of how we were after 9/11. We were ready to give it to them.'

Last-minute meeting: Jordan's King Abdullah II (left) met with President Obama at the White House on Tuesday after video emerged showing the brutal execution of one of his country's pilots by the ISIS terrorist group

Brutal: Footage titled 'Healing the Believers Chests' appears to show captured airman Moaz al-Kassasbeh wearing an orange jumpsuit as a trail of petrol leading up to the cage is set alight

Hunter told the Examiner that no one in the king's meeting on Tuesday with members of the House Armed Services Committee made any mention of President Obama, who is seen by some anti-ISIS coalition partners as a weak and indecisive actor.

South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said after a separate meeting with the king that Jordan would have a 'strong and forceful' response to the the fiery execution.

'The Jordanian response will be more engaged, not less engaged, when it comes to destroying ISIL,' Graham said.

'The king feels that the gloves are off and that it now is time if you can't negotiate with these people, you're going to have to take it to them, and I think it's going to be more than Jordan.'

Obama and Abdullah met Tuesday evening in a hastily arranged meeting just hours after a grisly video emerged showing al-Kassasbeh, who was 26 years old, being burned alive in a cage by ISIS.

They emerged from the meeting, vowing to continue their fight of the extremist group gaining control over large swathes of Iraq and Syria.

In addition, the State Department said Tuesday that the administration will increase its annual aid to Jordan to $1 billion from $660 million to help it pay for the cost of housing refugees from Iraq and Syria – and provide new resources to fight ISIS.

An agreement on the aid will require congressional approval.

In a brief statement, the U.S. State Department said it planned to provide $1 billion per year to Jordan for each of the U.S. fiscal years for 2015, 2016 and 2017. The U.S. fiscal year ends on Sept. 30.

Captured: Muath al-Kasasbeh (centre in white) was captured by the Islamic State after after crashing near its HQ in the Syrian city of Raqqa in December. ISIS is now believed to brutally murdered him

Al-Kassasbeh was captured in December when his F-16 jet crashed over northern Syria, a mission that was part of the U.S.-led coalition campaign against the jihadists.

During the meeting, President Obama offered 'his deepest condolences' to the king over the pilot's death

'The president and King Abdullah reaffirmed that the vile murder of this brave Jordanian will only serve to steel the international community's resolve to destroy ISIL,' said White House spokesman Alistair Baskey.

Obama earlier decried the 'cowardice and depravity' of the Islamic State, saying the brutal killing would only strengthen international resolve to destroy the extremists.

The White House would not speculate on whether the video was released to coincide with Abdullah's visit to Washington, where he was not scheduled to meet Obama.

The president said First Lieutenant Kassasbeh's 'dedication, courage and service to his country' represented 'universal human values that stand in opposition to the cowardice and depravity of ISIL.'

'Today, we join the people of Jordan in grieving the loss of one of their own,' the president added, as his administration reaffirmed its intention to give Jordan $3 billion in security aid over the next three years.

'As we grieve together, we must stand united, respectful of his sacrifice to defeat this scourge,' Obama said after the latest in a wave of grizzly filmed murders.

Jordanian state television said that Kassasbeh was killed on January 3.

The slaying would redouble international commitment to ensure the Islamic State group 'are degraded and ultimately defeated,' said Obama.

The extremists seized swathes of territory in Iraq and Syria last year, declaring an Islamic 'caliphate' and committing a wave of atrocities.

Countries as diverse as the United States, Saudi Arabia and Jordan responded with 'Operation Inherent Resolve,' an air-led campaign to pummel the jihadist group.

US Central Command meanwhile admitted that the Islamic State still had the ability 'to conduct small-scale operations,' despite months of air strikes.

But, it said, 'their capacity to do so is degraded and their momentum is stalling.'

Attacks have hit the group's 'ability to command and control forces; recruit, train and retain fighters, produce revenue from oil sales, and maintain morale.'

Islamic State had offered to spare Kassasbeh's life and free a Japanese journalist in return for the release of a female would-be suicide bomber on death row in Jordan.

Jordanian officials announced the female bomber and other jihadists would be executed on Wednesday."
"643","When Apple unveiled the Apple Watch, the unveiled three different editions: the Apple Watch, the Apple Watch Sport, and the Apple Watch Edition. The latter model appears to be catered to those who are more interested in fashion and luxury as the watch will be given an 18-karat gold treatment.
Sure, we guess it looks good but at the same time, have you ever wondered how much it will cost? Apple has declined to state a price of the Apple Watch Edition but according to the folks at TechCrunch, it is possible that the gold Apple Watch could retail for as much as $1,200. This is according Chad Rickicki, a watch expert who claims that the 18-karat gold Apple Watch would cost $600 just for the case, size, and shape alone, and that combine it with the electronics and markup, could end up being in the $1,200 range.
This is a significant leap over the base Apple Watch which Apple has said would be priced starting at $349, so safe to say it is an interesting direction that Apple is headed if they do indeed price the Edition at over $1,000. Given how Apple’s recent hires have come from the high-end fashion industry, we can’t say this is too surprising.
In fact a rumor earlier this year had even suggested that Apple could be preparing an Apple Watch that could cost thousands, thus making these claims slightly more believable. Either way we expect Apple will announce the prices in the near future as the Apple Watch has currently been pegged for a release in 2015."
"645","The Apple Watch will not be an accessory for your iPhone - but your iPhone will be an accessory for your Apple Watch, claims technology writer John Gruber, who expects the new wearable to cost upwards of $10,000 (£6,500/€8,800). Due to go on sale in April, the Apple Watch will start at $349 for the basic Sport model with a rubber strap, but beyond that no one knows how much the stainless steel and 18-karat gold Edition models will cost. A debate between technology and wristwatch experts is under way to determine how far into uncharted water Apple is willing to sail. First, Stephen Foskett of Grail Watch chimed in, suggesting (although using self-proclaimed ""back of envelope"" maths) the gold Apple Watch Edition will cost at least $10,000, based on the materials used. Foskett points to the huge gap in prices between stainless steel and gold versions of Swiss watches of a similar size and shape to the Apple Watch, noting how the Cartier Tank - a watch praised by Apple design chief Jony Ive - costs $7,000 in steel and $22,000 in pink gold. The Jaeger-LeCoultre Reverso Squadra Hometime, slightly larger than the 42mm Apple Watch, costs $8,550 in steel and $23,000 in gold - and a gold strap is a further $20,000. Apple must also price the Watch so it is protected against the volatility of gold. Foskett said: ""[Watchmakers] can't price near the commodity price because they have to set a price and stick to it all year long. So they generally price somewhat higher than they would, even taking into consideration all the rest of the materials, labour, distribution and profit in a watch."" Will the Apple Watch be gold plated to save costs? Apple Watch will go on sale before the end of April(Apple) Foskett says not. Although Apple doesn't describe the Watch Edition as being ""solid gold,"" it does say it is ""crafted from 18-karat gold,"" and nowhere is the material described as plated or gold filled. Entering the jewellery market means complying with new regulation, Foskett explains. ""There are laws covering descriptions of metal content for jewelry and Apple cannot break these any more than Tiffany could."" Add to this Apple's claims of producing the Watch from gold twice as hard as standard gold, and it is clear that the company will not be scrimping on materials. Foskett believes $9,999 for the 42mm model and $7,999 for the 38mm version of the gold Watch Edition could well be possible. Days later, Apple commentator John Gruber blogged to say he also thinks the price will be $10,000.

I don't think I was wrong to place a friendly late night bar bet on a $9,999 starting price [for the gold model]."" Gold straps Gruber says a ""starting price"" because he expects Apple to announce a new gold band when the Watch finally gets a price and release date - and for this he suspects the company will charge an additional $10,000. Looking at how Rolex charges a much higher premium for its gold models over steel - and for watches with identical movements - Gruber says the Apple Watch Edition ""is not a tech product, so don't try to price it like one... Apple's ambitions in this arena, I am convinced, are almost boundless."" Buying the Watch Edition will be unlike buying any other product in Apple's history. Reports claim the company will store the watches in safes, and that it is even considering completely separate boutique stores to sell them. Apple is expected to reveal the Watch's pricing structure and release date at a media event before the end of April 2014.

"649","A student has broken a 19-year silence and revealed she was the iconic sun baby in hit TV show Teletubbies.

Jess Smith, from Chatham, Kent, was selected to be the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old.

The show was a global hit and Miss Smith, a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University, became one of the most famous faces in the world - but only her family knew it was her.

Jess Smith (pictured left and right as a baby) was chosen as the giggling baby sun who looks over Teletubbyland when she was just nine months old - but kept her role a secret for 19 years

There were rumours the true identity of the baby was another Jessica Smith - the 27-year-old star of American teen soap Laguna Beach.

But Miss Smith has finally gone public and spoken for the first time about her role in the TV show which featured characters Tinky-Winky, Dipsy, Laa Laa and Po.

Miss Smith only revealed her secret during a game with her university friends - where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess.

She then used Facebook to confirm it was her - and photos show she still has the same cheeky face.

Miss Smith said: 'I thought I may as well tell them as I'm going to be spending the next three years with them. My mother is really chuffed.'

Miss Smith revealed her secret during a game with her university friends where they all had to say something about themselves that no one else would guess - she is pictured left and right as the smiling sun baby

She then made the news public on Facebook.

She wrote: 'So I've recently celebrated my 19th birthday and after a lot of thought, I've decided it's time to tell everyone.

'I used to hide it but after a lot of encouragement from my friends at university, I've gained the confidence to come out with it.

'I am the sun from Teletubbies. There has been quite a few people pretending to be 'the sun' but only I could tell you the real story.'

Miss Smith is now a first-year dance education student at Canterbury Christ Church University

Miss Smith added: 'Everyone says they can see the likeness between my face now and me as a baby. I still have a baby face. I haven't changed much either. I am still giggly.'

Miss Smith posted a picture of a letter her parents received from Courtyard Productions in Four Elms, Kent, on June 17, 1996, on Facebook proving she was the baby - not the American TV star Jessica Smith.

She said: 'I'm not sure why the actress is claiming to be the face or why people think she is.

'She would have been 10 at the time of filming - and she doesn't even look like the baby.

'My neighbours said I should put everyone right as they would be annoyed if it was them. But I wasn't that bothered until I told my uni friends.

'I am not sure why they picked me - I assume because I was more giggly than everyone else.'

She added: 'I do remember watching the Teletubbies when I was a child.

'When I was young I used to laugh along with the sun but it was only when I got older that I understood it was me.

'My close friends and family knew, but it just never interested me before to tell everyone.

'At uni we had to tell the person sitting next to us something about ourselves so I thought I would say it.

'Then people from uni convinced me to tell everyone and they encouraged me through it all.

'I am proud. I wouldn't change it for anything.

'My family will all remember it for ever. My nan has articles about me when I was baby all over her wall.'

As no one could predict the success of Teletubbies (pictured) Jess was paid £250 and given a box of toys

Her name was put forward when her mother Anji Smith, 44, a recruitment consultant, took her to be weighed at Edenbridge Hospital, Kent.

A health visitor had been asked by Ragdoll Productions to find smiley babies.

Miss Smith was put in a high chair for the filming so she would be looking down like the sun.

Her father Bill, 49, made her giggle by playing with a teddy bear behind the camera.

As no one could predict the success of the show, Jess was paid just £250 for filming and given a box of toys to take home.

Delighted Mrs Smith said: 'It was just something a bit different to do and we didn't expect it to be as big as it was.

Miss Smith (pictured left) with a friend, said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250

'They just sat her in front of a camera and she just laughed and smiled at her dad.'

Miss Smith said she is not disappointed by her small payment of £250.

The production company also sent the family a video of her performance and told them when the first show would be aired on TV.

She said: 'I am sure I loved the box of toys.

'No one knew how big the show was going to be so we didn't get offered royalties. '

She added: 'People told my mum that I should have gone into modeling but she thought it wasn't the right move to make as I was quite shy.'

Luckily Jess' little sister Lucy, now 17, hadn't been born when she took part in the filming so there were no arguments over who got the part.

The BBC is preparing to make 60 new episodes of the hugely popular 90s children's television show."
"650","An Indian man had his penis cut off with a meat cleaver by a vigilante group, after attempting to rape a teenage girl.

The 40-year-old rapist, Suresh Kumar, was beaten with sticks for about an hour before his genitals was cut off.

The incident occurred in the city of Ganganagar, where Kumar was left bleeding as his penis and testicles lay on the road next to him.

An eyewitness, Aamir Dhawan, who was at the scene, said people were reluctant to help the rapist, after seeing that his private parts had been cut off.

He said, “No one went to help the man because they could see his penis on the ground and knew this was punishment for a sex crime. We have had a lot of intolerable offences against women in this country recently, with girls being raped, hung, and molested, and it’s time it stopped. This sends out a very strong message to anyone like that – if you do it you will be punished.”

The police, has however, urged those responsible for the castration to come forward and submit themselves for prosecution.

A police spokesman said, “People cannot take the law into your own hands. As deplorable as these crimes are, law and order has to be maintained, and not lynch justice. We ask those men who carried out this attack to hand themselves in before we find them.”"
"651","Never one known for restraint, Vice Media’s Shane Smith may now have outdone even himself.

Mr. Smith, the chief executive of the provocative news and entertainment group, spent $300,000 for a dinner at the Prime Steakhouse at the Bellagio in Las Vegas during the International CES trade show in January, according to one person who was at the party and another one who knew about it.

Mr. Smith, whose company closed financing last September that valued it at $2.5 billion, paid for the meal personally. More than 30 people were at the dinner, including friends, other Vice executives and staff members and directors like Tom Freston, a founder and former chief executive of MTV who later went on to run Viacom, according to a person who attended the event.

Liquor flowed freely, with some bottles of wine costing more than $20,000, according to the people. The most expensive food item on the menu at the Prime Steakhouse, a Jean-Georges Vongerichten restaurant, is a 28-ounce bone-in rib eye for $85.

To foot the bill, Mr. Smith dipped into his more than $1 million in winnings from gambling, especially at the blackjack table, during the week, the people said.

News of the meal, which was first reported by Bloomberg, surfaced after executives at MGM Resorts International mentioned the outsize dinner bill during a company conference call on Tuesday. They cited it in response to a question from an analyst about how spending at the casino now compares with levels before the recession. MGM did not identify Mr. Smith as the guest who had hosted the dinner.

James J. Murren, the chief executive of MGM, said he had not seen a check that size for several years.

“People are starting to spend money remarkably here,” Mr. Murren said.

The lavish dinner is the latest caper by Mr. Smith, who is charting a new course as a brash next-generation media mogul. He is known to drink with old-school media executives in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, the hipster enclave where Vice has its headquarters. He has called CNN an expletive and rented villas at Cannes during an annual international media conference there.

“They live larger, and that is part of the Vice je ne sais quoi,” said Michael E. Kassan, the chief executive of the media and marketing consulting firm MediaLink, who is known to throw his own prominent industry dinners. “But they do good stuff. I am a big fan. They represent so much of what is new and exciting in the world.”

Mr. Murren of MGM told the analyst Harry C. Curtis of Nomura Securities that he couldn’t believe it when he first saw the tab. He said, “$300,000 for dinner at Prime. That’s a pretty good check. You would have liked the wine, Harry.”"
"652","The Apple Watch might have been four years in the making and the most Jony Ive-centric Apple product yet — but the company didn’t get everything it was wishing for from the device.

According to a new report from The Wall Street Journal, Apple originally wanted its smartwatch to focus far more prominently on health-related innovations, only to be forced to go in another direction midway through the project.

If Apple had had its way, the Apple Watch would have boasted smart sensors capable of tracking blood pressure, heart rate and even stress levels — but despite hiring top people from the biosensor industry, the technology didn’t work quite as well as had been hoped.

Problems were apparently posed by Apple Watch wearers with hairy arms and dry skin, with sensor results also varying depending on how loosely or tightly the watch is worn. Despite a heavy drain on Apple resources, engineers were unable to create a suitable solution in time for the company to reveal the device.

As a result, the Apple Watch shipping in April will be far more of an iPhone accessory/companion than had originally been planned, which is no doubt useful for growing Apple’s interlocking ecosystem but is less good in other ways. Although Apple has the luxury of taking its time with products, yesterday’s New Yorker story reveals how much pressure there was to announce a new category of device post-Steve Jobs.

While there’s still a lot to be excited for, the health-tracking applications of the Apple Watch were ones that people are very excited about. Apple has already had success introducing HealthKit into top hospitals, and a medically approved wearable could potentially help grow relations between Apple and the healthcare industry.

In a recent interview, Steve Wozniak discussed health-tracking as one of the most potentially exciting features of the Apple Watch. Cult of Mac has also written about the potential of the Apple Watch becoming your “digital doctor.”

Sadly, it seems we’re going to have to wait at least a couple of generations before the technology can live up to that billing."
"653","US officials say 11 commercial aircraft have gone missing from Tripoli International Airport in Libya – ahead of the 13th anniversary of the September 11 attacks on New York and Washington.

The airport was the scene of a fierce battle that ended on August 26, when fighters from the Islamic Fajr Libya (Dawn of Libya) coalition captured the airport and aircraft belonging to the state-owned Libyan Airlines and Afriqiyah Airways.

Pictures from the airport in the aftermath of the fighting showed severely damaged and totally destroyed aircraft.

Dawn of Libya was identified as a terrorist organisation by the Libyan government earlier this year.

While the US State Department is down-playing the significance of the missing planes, one official was quoted in the Washington Free Beacon as saying: ‘There are a number of commercial airliners in Libya that are missing. We found out on September 11 what can happen with hijacked planes.’

September 11 also marks the second anniversary of the raid of the US Ambassador’s compound in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans – including including US Ambassador Christopher Stevens – were killed.

Intelligence reports of the stolen aircraft include a warning that one or more of the planes could be used in terrorist attacks in the region. Another scenario involved using a plane with civilian markings to transport armed terrorists to an airport usually open to commercial aircraft.

Al Jazeera reported that the planes are being held by a group called the Masked Men Brigade, and it plans to use them in terror attacks.

"655","Elon University in North Carolina banned the word “freshman” from its website and student orientation, claiming it’s sexist and suggests that the young women might make good rape victims.

It’s replacing the term with “first-year.”

“The term has often been felt to refer to the vulnerableness of young women in college for the first time,” Leigh-Anne Royster, the school’s “Inclusive Community Wellbeing Director” told the College Fix.

“Given the rates of sexual violence perpetrated against women on college campuses, it is useful to examine any use of a term that suggests that a group of people just entering college might be targets for such violence in any way,” she added.

In fact, the word is apparently so dangerous that any orientation leader who dared to use it was immediately corrected.

“They engrained over and over in our brains that it was supposed to be ‘first-year,’ not ‘freshman,’” sophomore orientation leader Alaina Schukraft told the Fix. “They were very adamant . . . and stressed the importance of using language that would make the new students feel comfortable.” 

Ironically, Schukraft said that multiple students approached her and said they were actually more comfortable with the word “freshman.”

But no matter. Greg Zaiser, vice president of admissions and financial planning, insists that it will make the school a better place for women — telling the Fix that people consider “freshman” to be a “sexist” word.

“As an inclusive community, Elon strives to incorporate language that is current and reflective of our student body,” Zaiser said in an e-mail to the Fix.

No public announcement was made about the word switch. According to the Fix, administrators relied “largely on word of mouth.”

"657","Update at 8:50 p.m. EDT

The militant group that calls itself the Islamic State has released a video that purportedly shows the beheading of British aid worker David Haines.

The authenticity of the video, which appeared online Saturday, has not been independently confirmed by NPR.

The organization, also known as ISIS, had threatened to kill Haines just under two weeks ago, in an earlier video that showed the beheading of an American journalist. This weekend, Haines' family had issued a public plea to his captors through the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The family asked ISIS to make contact with them.

Haines, an international aid worker, was abducted in Syria in 2013. ""The British government had managed to keep his kidnapping secret out of concern for his safety until the most recent video Islamic State video identified him as a captive,"" the AP writes.

The BBC reports that the 44-year-old father of two from Perth, Scotland, was kidnapped shortly after he began working with a French relief agency called ACTED. At his posting there, Haines was ""working in the Atmeh refugee camp ... supplying water, food and tents.""

Over the past decade and a half he'd worked with a variety of aid agencies, writes the BBC: ""He had worked with a German charity on post-war reconstruction projects in Croatia, including housing and demining. He was also involved in efforts to help displaced people to return to their homes. In 2011 he became Head of Mission in Libya for Handicap International,"" an organization that works to help vulnerable people with disabilities.

""The following year he joined another agency, the Nonviolence Peaceforce (NP), and went to South Sudan,"" where he worked as an unarmed civilian peacekeeper.

ISIS previously released two videos showing the beheadings of two American journalists, which were confirmed by U.S. officials to be authentic. The first video, which showed the killing of James Foley, was released on August 20. The second, which showed the beheading of Steven Sotloff and contained the threat directed towards Haines, was released on Sept. 2.

The newest video, like those previous videos, appears to name another Western hostage as a future target.

NPR's correspondent Alice Fordham, reporting for our Newscast unit, says the video begins with footage of British prime minister David Cameron. The two previous videos began with footage of President Obama.

The man identified as Haines, Alice reports, is shown ""kneeling in a featureless desert in an orange robe.""

The video appears to be recent, Alice says: ""The assailant refers to the bombing of Iraq's Haditha dam a week ago. Another man identified as a British hostage appears at the end as the masked man exhorts Prime Minister Cameron to stop fighting the Islamic State.""

Cameron has tweeted a response, writing, ""We will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice, however long it takes.""

President Obama said in a statement that the U.S. ""strongly condemns the barbaric murder of UK citizen David Haines by the terrorist group ISIL,"" and pledged to work with the U.K. and other nations to ""bring the perpetrators of this outrageous act to justice."""

Now presumably Apple might want to make some kind of announcement regarding the prices and the finalized specs of the device, and given that it is their first wearable, it doesn’t seem like a stretch.
That being said, a report from French Apple website iGen (via AppleInsider) claims to have heard from their sources that this event could be held on the 24th of February in which Apple is expected to share the finalized specs and launch plans for the Apple Watch, and will also be announcing the rumored 12-inch MacBook Air.
Previously we have heard rumors that the 12-inch MacBook Air could be launched in Q1 2015 so an announcement either in February or by the end of March would coincide with the rumors. However we should also note that the folks at 9to5Mac have heard from their own sources that the 24th of February event will not be happening.
9to5Mac does not dispute the possibility of Apple holding a special event to launch their new products, but rather the actual date which their sources have told them will not be the 24th of February. Given that both websites have been pretty reliable when it comes to Apple rumors, it’s hard to say who’s right. Either way we will be keeping our eyes and ears peeled for a possible invite, but in the meantime try not to get your hopes up just yet.

Ting Su, 29, caught husband Cheng naked in an underground carpark in China along with her twin sister after tracking the pair down using a mobile tracking system.

When Su arrived on the scene to confront them, the surprised pair reacted to the bust and jumped out of the car.

"663","The man who jumped the White House fence Sept. 19 pushed his way past a female Secret Service agent before he was overpowered by a male agent in the building’s large East Room.

After he pushed past the female agent, he ran past the stairway that leads to the president’s personal quarters before he was detained.

The Secret Service’s response to Gonzalez’s dash from the front railing was slowed because perimeter alarms — dubbed “crash boxes” — had been muffled at the request of the White House’s ushers.

The man, Omar Gonzalez, is a former soldier, and was having delusions. The president was not at the White House when Gonzalez ran into the building.

The new revelation was published by the Washington Post and CBS.

The Post credited the new information to whistleblowers and Rep. Jason Chaffetz, the chairman of the House Oversight subcommittee on Homeland Security.

Chaffetz said the intrusion was a “failure of leadership” by the Secret Service.

Secret Service Director Julia Pierson has said the intrusion was “unacceptable” to her.

The report — likely leaked by Chaffetz — comes one day before Pierson testifies at his committee on Tuesday.

“The agency needs a solution that goes deeper than more fences and more people,” Chaffetz told the Washington Post.

“It must examine what message is being sent to the men and women who protect the president when their leader sacrifices security to appease superficial concerns of White House ushers.”

"664","Ahead of Monday's media event where Apple is expected to provide final details on the Apple Watch, a new report from TechCrunch details a hidden ""diagnostic port"" inside one of the channels on the Apple Watch where watch bands slip into place. While the port is currently used only for diagnostic purposes, the report argues it could be used in the future to interface with ""smart band"" accessories bringing additional functionality to the watch.The port has a 6-dot brass contact array inside the groove for the ‘bottom’ strap connector slot. Several sources have confirmed its existence and placement to me. It is very similar to the connector for the Lightning connector in iPhones, as that connector currently only uses 6 of its 8 available pins. Apple recently began opening up the Lightning port for use by third parties. A source says that this port is currently for diagnostic purposes only — but that there is nothing preventing it from being a connection port for future accessories.TechCrunch's Matthew Panzarino is careful to state that he has no knowledge of any plans by Apple to launch such smart band accessories, but the idea remains an intriguing one. Possibilities for such bands include additional sensors, external batteries integrated into a band, and more.

Apple revealed a number of high-level details about the Apple Watch at the device's unveiling last September, but even now with a launch set for next month there is still much that remains unknown, including pricing details beyond the $349 starting price. Apple will undoubtedly address many of the details at Monday's events, but some of the technical details will likely need to wait until the device launches and users and technical experts can get a closer look at the device.

Update 2:13 PM: The diagnostic port will not be included on the Apple Watch that ships to consumers, according to 9to5Mac.

“We have no credible, specific intelligence to that effect,” Johnson said on CNN Wednesday evening of the militants also known as ISIS. “And I look at the intelligence reports from overseas from our southern border from our intelligence community virtually every day, numerous times a day, to be on the lookout for something of that nature. So, what I’d say to the American public is we’re vigilant in looking out for individuals of suspicion who may be crossing our border.”

Johnson never mentioned Hunter by name, but he has called on lawmakers to act responsibly and not frighten Americans. “Let’s not unduly create fear and anxiety in the American public by passing on speculation and rumor,” Johnson said.

The group Judicial Watch reported late Wednesday that four “Islamic terrorists” had been seized along the southern border within 36 hours. Hunter said in an interview with Fox News on Tuesday that ""at least 10 ISIS fighters have been caught coming across the Mexican border in Texas."""

""Everyone knows I'm pretty competitive,"" Ryan Roche of Lehi, Utah, told ABC News today, explaining how his colleagues talked him into participating just as he was leaving the party with his family earlier this month.

""I just decided I was going to win. So I pretty much just opened it up and poured it down my throat,"" he said.

Homemade Eggnog Can Kill Salmonella with Booze
Roche, 33, said he shaved 10 seconds off the previous best time of 22 seconds that day, earning him bragging rights and a $50 gift certificate to Ruth's Chris Steak House. But the glory was short-lived: Later, at home, he started to feel sick.

""Two hours later I was laying on the couch, shaking uncontrollably, nauseous, having fevers and panting,"" said Roche, who works in sales.

His friend took him to the hospital while his wife stayed home with their three children.

In Roche's case, the eggnog may have literally gone down the wrong pipe, Dr. Robert Schilz of University Hospitals in Cleveland explained. The eggnog, which was booze-free, may have crept into Roche's windpipe, triggering pneumonia.

Roche spent a full day in the ICU and two more days recovering at the hospital.

""It was not fun,"" Roche said. ""It took me a full week of recovery to be 100 percent.""

"669","Dim Xiong Chien is a 22-year-old college student studying at the Liaoning Advertisement Vocational College in the city of Shenyang in northeastern China.

According to reports, earlier this week Chien organized a surprise proposal with fireworks for his girlfriend Cong Yen, but she never showed up. So he decided to set them off anyway, hoping she’d see the huge display.

The whole plan literally went up in flames when the fireworks lit the grass on fire. Firefighters were called in to put out the 10-foot-tall flames.

The school is currently debating how to punish Chien, but they told local reporters that luckily they were insured. Chien eventually did propose to Yen, though this time without a pyrotechnics display.

The story was originally reported by state-run newspaper Shenyang Evening News and then made its way — unfortunately for Chien — to Chinese social media site Weibo.

“Of course, I love him,” Yen told local reporters. “But my parents have told me to steer clear, saying he can’t even ask me to marry him without causing a massive hoo-ha.”"
"670","The Lebanese army has detained a wife and a son of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) group, as they crossed from Syria in recent days, security officials have said.

The military said that the wife was a Syian citizen and the detained son was nine years old.

According to the army statement, they were detained 10 days ago and have been questioned at the ministry of defence.

The Lebanese newspaper As-Safir reported the army detained her in coordination with ""foreign intelligence apparatus"". It said she had been travelling with a fake passport accompanied by one of her sons.

The armed ISIL group has seized wide areas of Iraq and Syria, Lebanon's neighbour to the east, declaring a ""caliphate"" over the territory it controls.

The Lebanese security forces have waged a crackdown on ISIL sympathisers in Lebanon and the intelligence services have been extra vigilant on the border crossings.

They have arrested over the past few months a number of ISIL fighters suspected of staging attacks to expand ISIL influence in Lebanon.

Snyder released this photo below, to make fun of that rumor and take a friendly shot at J.J. Abrams.

The caption to the photo read: “Case closed.”

These hilarious photos have been released throughout the shooting of both films (Batman v. Superman and Episode VII) by both directors, having a little fun with each other and using Twitter to do so.

Earlier this year, we have seen a couple of pics from Snyder, such as Henry Cavill as a Sith lord and Batman being followed by R2, in what looked to be Tatooine. J.J. Abrams and Bad Robot have fired back a friendly shot which included C3PO in Gotham with the Rebel Alliance symbol replacing the Bat symbol, which the caption read as “THE C3PED CRUSADER.”

Can we expect to see some friendly retaliation from J.J. Abrams and Bad Robot? I hope so! Keep an eye on both of the directors Twitter pages.

As for the rumor of the the stolen batmobile, the initial report by Bleeding Cool, has since been updated and debunked.

"674","A satirical website has poked fun at the Chinese practice of choosing alternative English names, in a report urging citizens to think carefully before making their decision.

The site, which is done in the style of the state-owned CCTV website, warns people against picking a name that could cause offence, or simply make no sense at all. Many Chinese people prefer to use an English name, particularly if they conduct business with the West. But the satirical site suggests people should avoid fictional characters, names with the potential for sexual innuendo, or random words like Dragon, Fish or Lawyer, which could come back and haunt you ""if you want a call back from that serious law firm in America"".

An English name should ""come with a 'feeling' or idea about what sort of person you are, and where you come from"", so names such as Satan or Dumbledore are out, the website says. Women are told to think carefully about ""food"" names such as Candy, Lolly or Sugar, which might be seen as ""stripper names"". There's also a lengthy warning about names with sexual connotations, especially when used in conjunction with Dong or Wang, which ""are used as slang for male genitalia... so avoid anything like 'Bunny Wang' at all times,"" the website says. Instead, a ""traditional"" name like Elizabeth, Catherine, William or George is considered a good choice. ""Pick one of these if you're looking for a 'safe' English name, often with implications of wealth,"" the website advises.

"677","Armed US drones, reportedly hunting for Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, were spotted flying over Syrian airspace where the jihadists have stronghold, reports suggest.
Residents of the northern Syrian city of Raqqa took photographs of remotely piloted planes flying over the area. Experts have identified the drones as 'US Predators', which were used in Pakistan and Yemen to attack suspected terrorists, The Telegraph reports.
The United States has not made this military activity public but there is a widespread expectation that the Obama Administration will be stepping up its efforts to defeat the hardliner Sunni militant outfit, which has captured swathes of area in Iraq's north and in Syria over the past few months, declaring  Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as its 'Caliph'.
The reports of the unmanned drones being sent to target the self-proclaimed leader of the Sunni extremist organisation, is a clear indication that the US will not back down in their mission to annihilate the terrorist group that has proved to be the greatest threat to Washington in recent times, which according to Pentagon, even surpasses that once posed by al-Qaeda.
Even as President Obama has succeeded in assembling nine NATO nations that are willing to join the US in crushing the militant group, diplomatic efforts to win support were further bolstered on Monday when Iraq's parliament voted to approve a new government under Haider Al-Abadi's leadership. The new government is expected to cooperate fully with the US in its ambition to defeat the insurgents.
The United States is particularly hopeful of better days ahead as Abadi, who is a member of Iraq's Shiite majority had earlier promised to include Sunnis and Kurds in his government. The US is convinced that ISIS's prominence and growth might somehow be checked if the country heals itself of the massive sectarian divide that it is suffering from.
The increased measure to check the militants' influence comes as the new head of the UN human rights office in Geneva, said the world's foremost human rights priority needs to be ending the deadly conflicts in Iraq and Syria.?

An Islamic State message published by the SITE Intelligence Group, which tracks jihadist activity, said the American woman, Kayla Mueller, was killed when the building where she was being held in the Raqqa area collapsed in an airstrike.

“The failed Jordanian aircraft killed an American female hostage,” said the message. “No mujahid was injured in the bombardment, and all praise is due to Allah.” Mujahid means fighter.

The group said the woman was killed by “fire of the shells dropped on the site.”

There was no immediate way to verify the claim by the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL. But it identified the hostage by name for the first time, and gave her address in Prescott, Ariz., apparently to add credibility to its message. The group also posted photographs of an obliterated house where, it said, Ms. Mueller's body had been buried beneath the rubble.

The White House said American intelligence officials were investigating the claim.

“We are obviously deeply concerned by these reports,” said Bernadette Meehan, a spokeswoman for the National Security Council. “We have not at this time seen any evidence that corroborates ISIL’s claim.”

Jordanian officials cast doubt on the Islamic State's claim but did not explicitly rule it out. Jordan's foreign minister, Nasser S. Judeh, said on his Twitter account that the claim was “An old and sick trick used by terrorists and despots for decades: claiming that hostages human shields held captive are killed by air raids.”

The Islamic State, which occupies parts of Syria and Iraq, has executed three other American hostages, all men, in beheadings that it posted on the Internet. An American-led coalition that includes Jordan and other Arab allies of the United States has been bombing Islamic State targets on a frequent basis for months.

Ms. Mueller, 26, the only known remaining American hostage held by the Islamic State, is a humanitarian aid worker who disappeared in August 2013 after she had driven into the northern Syria city of Aleppo with her Syrian boyfriend. Her colleagues received a proof-of-life video a few months later, showing her wearing a hijab and begging for her life.

Her family had asked news organizations to avoid identifying her by name while she was still in captivity. But the Islamic State's use of her name in its message on Friday changed their thinking, even though there was no proof she had been killed.

In a statement about Ms. Mueller, the family called her a passionate aid worker who had been taken captive by the Islamic State after she had left an Aleppo hospital run by Doctors Without Borders, the medical charity.

“The common threat of Kayla's life has been her quiet leadership and strong desire to serve others,"" the statement said.

Ms. Mueller, the statement said, had “devoted her career to helping those in need in countries around the world.”

The immolation death of the Jordanian pilot, First Lt. Moaz al-Kasasbeh, 26, which was posted on the Internet in a carefully produced Islamic State video on Tuesday, generated new levels of world outrage. It was never made clear when the pilot, who was captured in late December, had been killed.

Jordan hung two convicted terrorist prisoners, including a woman, in retaliation on Wednesday and launched bombing attacks on Islamic State targets in neighboring Syria as a further response for vengeance.

A senior United States military official with knowledge of the targets attacked by the Jordanians said the targets in and around Raqqa that were struck were carefully vetted and scrutinized, as with previous strikes, and there were no indications in advance that any hostages were located at the facilities.

“The same high standards we apply to all targets in the vetting stage were applied to these,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss military operations. “If there’s any inkling a person like that was there, we don’t go there.”

The official cautioned that without proof of the American hostage’s death, the statement by the Islamic State could be a ploy to cause the Jordanians and the rest of the American-led coalition to refrain from any heavier airstrikes.

The official said though the Jordanian fighter jets took the lead in the strike in and around Raqqa, they were accompanied by American aircraft, as is standard on bombing runs over territory held by the Islamic State in Syria."

Luke Somers was shot by his captors during a raid by US forces, a US official told the New York Times.

His sister, Lucy Somers, told the Associated Press that she had been notified by the FBI of his death.

US Defence Secretary Chuck Hagel confirmed the killing and said a second, non-US hostage, also died.

Yemen's defence ministry confirmed a ""major operation"" had taken place in Yemen's southern Shabwa province on Saturday.

Mr Somers, who was kidnapped in Yemen in 2013, had appeared in a video appealing for help.

""We ask that all of Luke's family members be allowed to mourn in peace,"" Lucy Somers told AP, speaking from London.

A drone strike believed to have been carried out by the US is reported to have killed nine suspected al-Qaeda militants in the region.

Mr Somers, 33, worked as a journalist and photographer for local news organisations. His material appeared on international news outlets, including the BBC News website.

He was kidnapped outside a supermarket in the Yemeni capital Sana'a in September 2013 and is believed to have been sold on to al-Qaeda in the Arab Peninsula (AQAP).

The video of him released this week showed a member of AQAP threatening to kill Mr Somers unless unspecified demands were met.

The Pentagon confirmed that an an attempt to rescue Mr Somers last month had failed.

His family appealed in a video to al-Qaeda militants in Yemen to ""show mercy"" and release him.

""Luke is only a photojournalist and is not responsible for any actions the US government has taken,"" his brother, Jordan, said in a video.

AQAP is regarded by the US as one of the deadliest offshoots of al-Qaeda.

As the anchor said, social media, as well as a few news websites, owes meteorologist Mike Seidel an “apology” after some “wild misinformation” circulated about what he was doing during a live appearance with Lester Holt over the weekend.

Williams explained that Seidel has lost communication with the NBC station and couldn’t hear Holt through his earpiece so he turned his back to the camera, took off his gloves and redialed his phone to connect for the segment.

“That’s when the rumors hit the web that he was perhaps writing his name in the snow,” Williams said. “It was just Mike working to make it right, which is why we all love working with Mike Seidel.”

But, of course, that explanation is far less hilarious and would likely generate almost zero clicks.

"687","Robots are increasingly replacing humans in a variety of mundane tasks, like bolting a car together or making lollipops, but now they are moving into the security business.

Microsoft recently installed a fleet of 5-feet-tall, 300-pound robots to protect its Silicon Valley campus. The robots are packed with HD security cameras and sensors to take in their organic, protein-based surroundings. There’s also an artificial intelligence on board that can sound alarms when the robot notices something awry. It can also read license plates and cross-reference them to see if they’re stolen.

The K5 robots come from a California company called Knightscope, which calls the robots “autonomous data machines” that provide a “commanding but friendly presence.” Sounds like something a robot manufacturer would say.

Let’s be honest though, the robots look pretty damn cool. They’re like modern versions of R2-D2.

Thankfully—or sadly, depending on how you look at it—the K5 robots don’t have any weapons on them. All they can do is assess a situation, sound an alarm to defuse it, or call a human security officer to the scene. There are, however, plans equip the robots with tasers sometime in the future.

Microsoft’s new protectors are fairly autonomous. A single charge will last 24 hours, and if the robot notices that its battery is getting low, it will return to a charging port and plug itself in. It can fully recharge in 20 minutes, which is pretty insane.

There are plans to one day expand the use of Knightscope’s robots and have them patrol the streets as part of human police units. We can’t even imagine what would happen if Elon Musk heard about this.

"688","The Islamic State terror group has burned the corpses of five of its fighters due to the belief that they had contracted the deadly Ebola virus, according to an Iraqi health official who told Kurdish paper Rudaw.

“The Islamic State organization incinerated five militants infected with Ebola to prevent further spread of the disease in Mosul (Iraq),” said Faisal Ghazi, who is part of Iraq’s Health Committee in its council of ministries. He added, “ISIS had proof that these militants were infected with Ebola.”

On New Year’s Day, Breitbart News reported that multiple Iraqi and Kurdish news outlets had claimed that Islamic State fighters in Mosul, Iraq had contracted the deadly virus. Iraqi news outlets claimed at the time that Ebola had started to spread in a Mosul hospital.

A World Health Organization (WHO) official told Mashable at the time, “We have no official notification from the Iraqi government that it is Ebola.

Kurdish news site Xendan elaborated further, reporting that the ISIS fighters’ symptoms were similar to those who had contracted Ebola. An Iraqi paper claimed that the virus had made its way into Mosul through jihadists who were recruited out of Africa.

However, most of the Islamic State’s Africa-based recruits have come from countries where Ebola has not had a documented presence. It also remains unclear whether Mosul health officials would even have the means, training or education necessary to test for Ebola. Furthermore, an Iraqi government spokesman, Ahmed Rudaini, told Al-Maalomah News that Mosul simply doesn’t have the technology available to confirm an Ebola case."
"689","(CNN) -- The mystery surrounding North Korea's erratic young leader, Kim Jong Un, only deepens by the day.

He has not been seen publicly in more than a month.  Rumors are flying that Kim is ill with gout, diabetes, even possible problems with his ankles. Now, a group of defectors say they believe Kim's younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, may be running the country while he recuperates.

The North Korea Intellectuals' Solidarity, a think-tank run by defectors, says Kim Yo Jong may be at least temporarily leading the government. The group has not revealed the source of its information, and CNN cannot independently confirm it. But Kim Yo Jong's star appears to be rising.

Why has North Korea decided to talk now?

Michael Madden, who runs the blog North Korea Leadership Watch, says Kim Yo Jong has been identified in North Korean media as deputy director of the Workers' Party, a very powerful position.

Victor Cha, an analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies who previously handled the North Korea account with the National Security Council, says Kim Yo Jong began surfacing publicly earlier this year at party functions.

""Clearly it's an effort to slow-track her into becoming somebody who is important within the system,"" Cha says. ""I can see how it's possible that she's in some sort of temporary position. It's very difficult for the North Korean system to run without one of the Kim family at least titularly in charge. So, if Kim Jong Un is indisposed, she's really the only available body that's left, in terms of a direct Kim family line.""

Is Kim Jong Un still in charge of North Korea?

Who is Kim Yo Jong?

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was born in 1987 or 1988, and attended private school in Switzerland with Kim Jong Un. They both stayed at the North Korean embassy while attending the Swiss school, Madden says, and lived there under assumed names.

Madden says Kim Yo Jong is the youngest of seven siblings their father, Kim Jong Il, had with four women. Many of them are half-siblings, but Kim Jong Un and Kim Yo Jong have the same mother.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Madden says Kim Yo Jong was always close to her father, and after returning from Switzerland, she was appointed to positions of responsibility in the government. She would act as an advance-team leader, inspecting sites before official visits, and had administrative duties as well.

Now, he says, she continues those duties and has taken on more responsibility under her brother's rule: dealing with policy and receiving intelligence briefings. She acts ""almost like a White House chief-of-staff would,"" Madden says.

He says he believes she had a large role in planning the recent trip by three top North Korean officials to South Korea while her brother was absent from the scene.

Opinion: Why Kim is probably still in charge

Ready for prime time?

Given her age and that so little is known about Kim Yo Jong, North Korea-watchers are concerned about her being in the top leadership spot, if only temporarily. The stress and palace intrigue inside the North Korean regime, they say, may be overwhelming.

""If in fact she is running the country -- as someone in their early to mid twenties, to me that is quite alarming,"" Cha says. ""It means there is something seriously wrong with Kim Jong Un and there is some sort of void that they're desperately trying to fill.""

All eyes will be on a significant event this Friday, October 10. That's the 69th anniversary of the founding of the ruling Workers' Party. Kim Jong Un attended the anniversary event last year. If he doesn't show up at Friday's ceremonies, concern over his public disappearance will only grow.

If he does attend, intelligence analysts will be looking at his appearance, his body language -- every detail -- very carefully.

"690","Apple’s next-generation MacBook Air, which is expected to come with a 12-inch screen, will have a “radically new design” that will abandon traditional specifications to produce a noticeably thinner and lighter device compared to the current 11-inch model, according to a report.

The upcoming MacBook Air is expected to be about a quarter-of-an-inch narrower than the 11-inch version, while also sporting a quarter-of-an-inch taller body in order to incorporate the slightly larger display, 9to5Mac reported, citing “sources within Apple” with access to “internal prototype versions” of the device. The bezels on the display could also be narrowed out on all sides to get a larger display fitted into the footprint, which is about the same size as the current 11-inch version's.

In addition to the 12-inch screen, the new MacBook Air could also feature an edge-to-edge keyboard with a redesigned key set, allowing each key to sit closer together, the report said, adding that the move is said to be aimed at making the computer as compact as possible.

The new model could also feature a revamped trackpad with the same width as that found on the 11-inch version, but with a taller frame almost touching the bottom of the keyboard, 9to5Mac reported, adding that the new trackpad may come without the clicking effect found on existing MacBook models.

Just above the keyboard of the next-generation MacBook Air, there could be four new speaker grilles that are expected to also function as ventilation ports, as the device lacks traditional computer fans.

In a bid to achieve a significantly thinner form factor, the 12-inch MacBook Air could do away with standard USB ports, the SD Card slot, and Thunderbolt and MagSafe charging standards in favor of a single USB Type-C port, which is reportedly smaller, faster and better than the existing USB 2.0 and 3.0 ports. In addition, the USB Type-C port is reversible, similar to that of the Lightning connector on the latest iOS devices. While the new USB Type-C port will sit on the left side of the device, the right side will accommodate the headphone jack, along with input and noise-canceling microphones, according to the report.

The details of the 12-inch MacBook Air closely follow recent rumors that the device could enter mass production in the first quarter of 2015. According to a report from Taiwan’s DigiTimes in December, Apple’s suppliers were stocking up inventory of related components for the new MacBook Air, in anticipation of the device entering production."
"691","Update: The original source of the story, Bloomberg now adds that the face of Michelle Obama was not blurred by the State TV. It quotes several journalists from within Saudi Arabia covering the event, adding that the State TV in fact did not blur the face of the First Lady anyway.

According to Nail al-Jubeir, information director at the Saudi Embassy in Washington, the blurring isn’t real.

“Saudi TV has been showing the total arrival ceremony at the airport and at the Palace and nowhere is anything blurred.”

CNN correspondent Hala Gorani also tweeted out that the Saudi TV in fact did not blur Michelle Obama’s face.

Our Nic Robertson in Riyadh telling me footage he saw on Saudi TV did not show a blurred Michelle Obama. On that note, Good night Twitter!

— Hala Gorani (@HalaGorani) January 27, 2015

Original Story:

U.S. President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama might have found it apt to cut short their trip to India to pay homage to former Saudi King Abdullah, who passed away last week. The Saudis, however, don’t seem to be enamored by the presence of the First Lady in their country.

According to a report by Bloomberg, the Saudi state television allegedly blurred out the face of Michelle Obama during a brief televised meeting between the new Saudi King Salman and the President at Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. In fact, the new King reportedly refused to acknowledge the presence of the First Lady and did not say hello or shake hands with her, the report adds. Other media houses from the Middle East, however, showed the unedited footage of the meeting without obscuring the face of Michelle Obama.

Hours after the state TV ran those clips, several of them were posted to Facebook, reports the Washington Times. However, most of the videos were subsequently taken down — probably at the behest of Saudi’s Internet Police. A version of the clip is now up on YouTube. We are unsure, however, how long it would remain there. We have managed to capture a screenshot of the video, just in case. The video is embedded below.

Meanwhile, Michelle Obama also faced criticism from some Arab media outlets for her decision to wear blue on her visit. They added that the First Lady should have worn a black dress, which is more appropriate for a funeral. Also pertinent to note was the fact that Michelle Obama did not wear a head scarf during the time she was out in public. As per Saudi law, all women in the country, even visitors, are required by law to wear a head scarf while in public. This is perhaps why the state TV blurred the First Lady out entirely.

There is also talk about the new Saudi King insulting Barack Obama by breaking protocol. The new King apparently abruptly turned around and walked away from the President in order to go for a prayer. This, however, could have been due to the inexperience of the new King, others allege.

Later in the day, the Saudi King held bilateral talks with other senior staff, including Secretary of State John Kerry, Senator John McCain, National Security Adviser Susan Rice, Ambassador Joseph Westphal, and CIA director John Brennan. A statement by the White House later announced the following.

“Obama and Salman sat in gold chairs. A small table in front of them held a spray of white flowers.”

The alleged decision by the Saudi state television to blur the face of Michelle Obama once again raises the question of women’s rights in Saudi Arabia. The country has strict laws that restrict freedom of movement of women. In fact, it was only recently that the country gave womenfolk the right to vote. It is also the only country in the world where women are not allowed to drive. Now, with even the wife of the world’s most powerful man being targeted, albeit indirectly, the world is certain to take note.

@ScottMacBain we have no record of this in our news lists. Please delete tweet or face legal charges. — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015

And the faker responded with anger:

@Victorialush this false statement is not from our news list. Please delete or face legal action. — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015

Fox News confirmed to Mediaite on Monday that this account is, in fact, a fake.

Though that likely won’t stop the fraudulent tweeters from issuing an empty lawsuit threat against us, like they did to the Washington Examiner:

We have been made aware that individuals posing as ourselves have been quoted by @dcexaminer. We will be pursuing legal recourse for mis… — Fox News Press Team (@FoxNewsPress) January 12, 2015

"698","Amazon boss Jeff Bezos is primed and ready for a fresh assault on the streaming-video space.

The e-commerce giant will roll out a new ad-supported streaming offering early next year that will be separate from its $99-a-year Prime membership, which includes a video service, sources said.

The ad-supported option — part of an overhaul of its media offerings — poses a serious challenge to streaming rivals such as Hulu and Netflix, analysts said.

“If they do an ad-supported service, they will decouple it from Prime and that is a Netflix killer,” Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter said. “It won’t be $99 a year.”

Pachter suggested Amazon would undercut Netflix’s current monthly price of $7.99.

“Who wouldn’t switch if you were poor or you’re a cord-cutter?” he added.

Although it will be separate from Prime, the ad-supported service is ultimately a bid by Amazon to lure people to eventually pay up for Prime membership, said one ad source familiar with Amazon’s plans.

“The main point is to bring in more users that you can eventually up-sell to Prime, or to get to a broader audience that doesn’t want to pay for Prime, in order to increase their video share,” the source said.

The Wall Street Journal reported in March that Amazon was weighing such a move, but sources confirmed that it’s a definite go.

Amazon is prepping a new attack at a time when its video service is gaining ground, sources said. Amazon doesn’t disclose the number of Prime members, but RBC Capital analyst Mark Mahaney estimates it has 50 million global customers.

While Prime’s big draw has been two-day shipping, about half of Prime subscribers use the video service that is included with it, or around 25 million, sources said. By comparison, Netflix has 33 million domestic subscribers.

A recent Sandvine study also shows that Amazon is making major strides — but has a long way to go before catching Netflix. Amazon’s broadband traffic on fixed networks grew from 1.61 percent to 2.58 percent, the study showed. One change is that Amazon snagged popular HBO content, including “The Wire,” “True Blood” and “Boardwalk Empire.” Netflix accounts for 32.39 percent of aggregate traffic.

Rumors have been rampant that Amazon plans to let advertisers into its media ecosystem. Amazon has already experimented with ads in some shows, according to tech site Re/code.

For advertisers, the service could be the Holy Grail in terms of targeting. In theory, Amazon could tell if ads viewed online led to purchases on its retail site.

The news that Nielsen will start rating shows on subscription video services starting with Netflix is likely to encourage advertisers who want to make the leap without forcing Amazon to give up its own data.

Amazon will also have leverage over content producers when it comes to the way it chooses to promote shows and movies within its growing ecosystem, a Hollywood source said.

Amazon didn’t return a call seeking comment."
"699","You can purchase a lot of things for $800 million. Ten Matthew McConaughey’s, eighty-billion pieces of penny candy, my dignity. But the one thing it can’t buy: a Led Zeppelin reunion. Also, a cure for AIDS, probably, but also the Led Zeppelin thing. Jimmy Page and John Paul Jones agreed to a “35 dates in three cities” tour, but Robert Plant was having none of it, and like a poorly written character in an Aaron Sorkin script, he literally ripped up a contract.

[Plant] and the other living founding members of legendary hard-rock band Led Zeppelin were about to ink an $800 million contract with Virgin Atlantic billionaire Richard Branson to play a reunion tour, but the iconic band’s singer ripped the contract to shreds in the final moments, a report said.

Branson was left stunned when the 66-year-old Plant tore the agreement to pieces right in front of the concert promoters, the newspaper said.

“There was an enormous sense of shock,” a source told the Mirror. “He said no and ripped up the paperwork he had been given.” (Via)

Branson’s dream of a Zeppelin reunion crashed as horribly as the VSS Too Soon. Nothing’s going right for that handsome, charismatic billionaire lately…"
